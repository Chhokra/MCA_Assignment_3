cystic fibrosis affects 30000 children young adults us alone
inhaling mists salt water reduce pus infection fills airways cystic fibrosis sufferers although side effects include nasty coughing fit harsh taste
thats conclusion two studies published weeks issue new england journal medicine
found inhaling mist salt content 7 9 improved lung function cases produced less absenteeism school work
cystic fibrosis progressive frequently fatal genetic disease affects 30000 young adults children us alone marked thickening mucus makes harder clear lungs debris bacteria
salt water solution really opens new avenue approaching patients cystic fibrosis treat says dr gail weinmann us national heart lung blood institute sponsored one studies
mark elkins royal prince alfred hospital sydney australia colleagues authored one new published studies
team found 83 volunteers regularly inhaled 7 mist salty water fewer breathing problems less absenteeism school work inhaled solution salt content 1
adding salt water airway surfaces patients cystic fibrosis beneficial children adults conclude
patients first inhaled chemical try open lung passages much possible
second study usbased assistant profsesor scott donaldson university north carolina chapel hill colleagues found 7 salt mist produced sustained acceleration mucus clearance improved lung function helped hydrate lungs
accompanying editorial dr felix ratjen hospital sick children toronto canada cited several unpleasant side effects salt mist treatment including bad taste coughing fits lengthy 30 minutes take administer
added study elkins team patients may received best longterm antibiotic treatment
would make inhaled salt water mist appear effective would people getting better drug says ratjen
weinmann says limitations inherent treatment mean salt water mist may first step treating cystic fibrosis

new fridge magnets aware others fridge communicate
fridge magnets may one day able fix bad grammar change words something think appropriate
idea magnet aware magnets fridge transmit information says australian digital artist pierre proske
proske working researchers future applications lab viktoria institute sweden develop intelligent fridge magnets
details presented international conference intelligent user interfaces sydney later month
fridge magnet consists 16character liquid crystal display rather magnetic strip printed word proske says
magnets randomly generate word categorise word noun verb adjective adverb transmit category words placed next
compose poem placing words grammatical order magnets communicate learn grammar rules using
trained magnets change words displaying substitute words dont fit established grammar rules like autocorrect function
actual word thats associated magnet change depending way aligned says proske
reshuffling gives new word
luckily dont like word magnet substitutes always take magnet fridge shake reshuffle get new word
plan able reset magnets completely forget grammar rules
course magnets rely taught good grammar first place
someone could instil bad grammar wanted says proske
doesnt want take fun kitchenbased partygoers like making crazy sentences fridges
says system worry words immediately next wont strict grammar sentence whole
deliberate keep sentences little poetic says proske
idea still fridge poetry dont want create sentences make total sense
changing words fit themes
team also hopes magnets able substitute words response stimuli bad grammar
example someone might set magnets home fridge set magnets work fridge communicate via wireless internet says proske
magnets home read example crazy kangaroos dream wildly work might change drunk wallabies laze around pool keeping australian theme

brain imaging reveals sex differences
second phase volunteers placed magnetic resonance imaging scanner device shows blood flows within brain
volunteer given demonstration mild shock equivalent short beesting watched actors standing next scanner got painful treatment
fair actor received shock scanner showed empathy among volunteers
males females alike images showed activation anterior insulafrontoinsular cortex aifi anterior cingulate cortex acc previous research showed parts brain cause feeling distress one sees someone else pain
unfair actor got shock aifi acc lit among female volunteers amongst men empathic areas showed increase activity
reward centre activated men
men watched unfair actors suffering show activation nucleus accumbens part brain associated satisfaction reward activation seen female volunteers
singer says results show fairness social situations shapes nature emotional link people
empathise others cooperate act fairly contrast selfish unfair behaviour compromises empathic link says
singer believes fundamental responses individual level played key role social evolution

findings suggest drinking water might help decrease sensitivity pain
going without drink make sensitive pain study found
australian pain expert dr michael farrell howard florey institute melbourne team report findings todays issue proceedings national academy sciences
another demonstration plasticity pain responses says
particular instance mild perturbation electrolyte levels fundamentally gives rise thirst enough modify pain response
farrell team studied relationship thirst pain 10 people
study participants pressure applied thumbs induce mild pain given saline injections stimulate thirst
researchers used pet positron emission tomography scan measure blood flow brains
results showed people thirsty felt pain
two regions brain pregenual cingulate ventral orbitofrontal cortex turned either input alone lit suggesting location two sensations integrated
researchers find pain affected thirst levels farrell says could participants made thirsty first place decrease would hard measure
logic behind findings
farrell says team speculated might circuits brain allow one sensation modulate another important point view survival
hunger thirst tiredness pain example dont conveniently happen time says important body prioritise
says pain accentuated important survival mild thirst
sensation immediate implications survival pushed forefront attention says farrell
drinking cut pain
farrell says findings suggest could wise people go painful experience drink water beforehand
says evidence different types studies also support relationship drinking water pain
could people deliberately use dehydration maximise pain say via torture
necessarily says farrell
suspect got dehydrated enough overwhelming sense thirst would probably make pain less rather
previous studies rats shown mild thirst makes animals feel pain severe dehydration actually dulls pain says
says makes sense point view survival
dehydrated would pay suppress pain might get way search water says
ethical limitations study
farrell says would hard study participants already spent three hours table test whether drinking decreased pain
theyve got plastic mask holding head perfectly still theyve got arms spread one hypertonic solution going one vein one getting radioactive isotopes would intolerable says
testing whether dehydration would dulled pain would similarly tricky ethically says

humans may domesticated dogs much recently dna studies suggest
one extensive surveys earliest known dog burials suggests humans domesticated canines much later studies show
survey suggests domestication occurred 13000 17000 years ago counters earlier theories based gene changes distinguish dogs wild wolf counterparts
theories held domestication occurred anywhere 40000 135000 years ago much earlier new study suggests
new study published february issue journal archaeological science suggests bond humans dogs coincides canine burials
earliest known morphological evidence probabably dog remains dates around 17000 years ago central russia
practice burying dogs appears begun 14000 15000 years ago burying dogs became common around 12000 years ago
time major population expansion starting purposes colonisation first time eastern eurasia finally new world says author darcy morey assistant professor archaeology university kansas
mushy fuzzy seems folks little willing try things like drift previously unoccupied expanses maybe engage humananimal associations resulted domestication
morey believes canine genetic break wolves may linked domestication
quite simply dog wolf genomes really separate long ago molecular studies suggested even vicinity animals destined become dogs must made living time essentially oldfashioned way like wolves says
evolving relationship
burials reveal evolving relationship dogs often dog skeletons lay alongside human ones
one 7000yearold swedish grave archaeologists found remains dog stretched legs deceased man though man hoped hold pet canine friend eternity
dogs neck broken indicating killed owner died
dogs buried without humans north central america still show loving touch possibly ritualised internment
grave found rhode island example contains prehistoric dog arranged lie left side front paw head
sign times
age condition dogs died also reveal domestication bond humans according morey
describes middle archaic burial dating 6700 7180 years ago found tennessee male dog discovered grave unusually old
skeleton indicates animal suffered traumatic injuries arthritis persistent infection broken bones healed
pathological condition individual suggests owner insured safety wellbeing individual throughout life since doubtful given traumatic age degenerative manifestations dog could survived absence care morey explains
evidence
christyann darwent assistant professor anthropology university california davis says agrees moreys time window dog domestication
dogs humans could hanging together long 17000 years ago domestication means manipulating breeding probably didnt happen recently says
burials represent best evidence strong social ties exist dogs humans
darwent says domestication benefited dogs humans suggests humans take responsibility alteration canines millennia
dogs pet reliant humans could never fend wild says
must remember manipulated much domestication often must depend upon us survival

adding immune system booster diluted vaccines may mean little vaccine goes long way
much smaller doses vaccines may needed combat outbreaks bird flu tuberculosis sars thought canadian research shows
research team university british columbia could mean shots available
team led professor wilfred jefferies says standard doses reduced 100fold still safe adding immune system booster commonly found human body
study shows immune system booster added low doses vaccines injected mice exposed rabies measles smallpox immune response kicks protect infection
socalled tap molecules deliver peptides inside cells bodys immune system vaccines
transporter switched cancerous cells disease fighters cannot moved need go within cell job
results sevenyear study published recent issue journal plos pathogens
new paradigm shown applicable many viruses including poxviruses could significantly advance creation new vaccines improve already exist scientists say
could prove especially important h5n1 bird flu expected many next worldwide pandemic begins pass humans
happens bird flu outbreak
bird flu killed 85 people since emerging asia 2003 experts say could kill millions mutates form easily passed humans
could take six months develop vaccine humantohuman transmission occur smaller dose sizes hundred times vaccine shots could made within period time
hoping incorporated number different vaccines says jefferies powerful think make general vaccines much better
smaller doses also make vaccines including smallpox anthrax less toxic therefore better tolerated weaker immune systems jefferies says
hiv patients particular could benefit well estimated 20 population react badly vaccines
pathogens dont currently effective vaccines says coauthor timothy vitalis hope technology used solve needs controlling infectious diseases
boost vaccine

neanderthals used knowledge animal behaviour hunt mountain goats like caucasian turs like early humans
neanderthals disappear modern humans better hunters thus outcompeted resources say us israeli anthropologists
contrary top predators knew hunt biggest fastest animals
neanderthals went extinct 30000 years ago inhabited europe parts asia roughly 200000 years
reason demise long debated frequently attributed modern humans greater intelligence consequently greater hunting skills
evidence animal remains hunted neanderthals clearly indicates hominids good early modern humans hunting report daniel adler assistant professor palaeoanthropologist university connecticut colleagues february issue journal current anthropology
researchers examined abundant faunal remains particular thousands bones belonging mountain goat species called caucasian tur still exists today
trove excavated ortvale klde rock shelter southern caucasus republic georgia dated 60000 20000 years ago
evidence killing
doubt animals hunted killed indeed bones featured cut marks human butchering fragmentations typical marrow consumption showing meat processing behaviours significantly different neanderthals modern humans
given abundance animals one might think neanderthals would kill many animals possible regardless age therefore nutritional returns says adler
analysis tooth wear revealed twothirds animals animals prime age strongest fastest nutritious difficult capture members herd
neanderthals like modern humans followed quite savvy choosing instead maximise dietary intake per energy expended hunting prime age adults
given species involved rough terrain would require sophisticated hunting tactics knowledge animal behaviour particular migration routes flight behaviour group cooperation adler says
expert timing
neanderthals timed hunts late autumn early spring caucasian turs seasonal migration lower elevations site ortvale klde located
maintained intimate relationship environment capable understanding exactly particular resources could found abundance adler says
archaeologist john shea associate professor stony brook university says
study excellent precisely needed comparison neanderthals modern humans used landscape close enough time differences discovered reflect behavioural differences environmental ones
still mystery
shea believes multiple factors varying region region may played role disappearance neanderthals
simple answer question neanderthals became extinct nobody knows studies like one certainly move us lot closer able make clearly testable hypotheses says
hypothesis neanderthals became extinct ineffective hunters deep trouble

researchers found two sister species palms living side side tiny world heritage listed island 580 kilometres australias east coast
two species kentia thatch palm howea forsteriana curly palm h belmoreana appear diverged began flowering different times year probably result differing soil preferences
international team researchers including uks royal botanic gardens kew reports findings online today journal nature
generally accepted evolution occurs one species breaking two process allopatric speciation
might occur say mountain range separates species two populations change gradually become different longer interbreed
also theoretical reasons believe species split two within area phenomenon known sympatric speciation
researchers used range techniques show palm species sisters indeed diverged much recently islands creation volcanic activity 6469 million years ago
calculate palms common ancestor probably arrived mainland australia long 4555 million years ago recently h forsteriana diverged related species ancestor h belmoreana
soil key
note flowering times palm trees differed different soils indicating ancestors two species may adapted different soil types
add perhaps living different soil types modified palm trees flowering times reducing chance interbreeding
thats probably kickstarted speciation process resulted finally two separate species says associate professor david rowell australian national university canberra

quite sure started seeing phenomenon seeing sound waves unexpected kept rechecking retesting results says burrows
astronomers long trying understand happens supernova massive star collapses explodes
reaches deaths door supernovas core dense allow energy escape star collapses inwards towards core
scientists assumed spectacular explosion stars dying moments due stars outer shell bouncing back core
says australian supernova expert dr stuart ryder angloaustralian observatory sydney none models exploding supernovae date supported theory
basically models dont show enough energy coming core bounce overcome collapsing outer layers
stuff trying expand would keep running stuff still collapsing would literally stall explosion says ryder
various attempts tweak models including taking account neutrinos emitted supernovae
scientists found subatomic particles also provide enough energy make models work models still stalled explosion
sound waves provide missing link
burrows team developed computer models simulate events dying star collapse core supernova explosion
simulations show inner core starts execute pulsations says burrows
show 500 milliseconds core collapses inner core begins vibrate wildly 600 700 800 milliseconds oscillation becomes vigorous sends sound waves

new models involve million steps simulate full second core collapse explosion
previous models take account sound waves one fifth number steps simulate first hundred milliseconds core collapse

friendship may important primates humans new research suggests
female baboons suffer loss close friend relative turn baboons comfort support according new study
study encompasses 14 years observing 80 freeranging baboons botswanas okavango delta

findings also suggest friendship may important primates humans
researchers particularly struck behaviour one female chacma baboon papio hamadryas ursinus named sylvia
described queen mean disdainful baboons lost daughter sierra lion kill
week sierra died sylvia withdrawn says dr anne engh led project
females grooming socialising tended sit alone rarely interacted even relatives
engh postdoctoral researcher department biology university pennsylvania adds
week two moping around sylvia suddenly initiated grooming several lowranking females think surprised seemed awfully nervous first eventually sylvia settled close relationships lowranking female sierras daughter margaret
relieving stress
engh says grooming friendly behaviour similar two human friends chatting drink
activity seems relax participants point lower stress hormone levels levels rise humans baboons close friend relative dies
researchers measured group hormones called glucocorticoids sylvia 20 females baboons experienced losses elevated levels hormones deaths
humans associated bereavement likely baboons also grieve dead
mourning animals widened social circles approaching grooming females even beneath rank
appeared help cope losses since stress hormone levels significantly dropped afterwards
discovery outlined recent proceedings national academy sciences paper underscores importance friendship
humans baboons socially integrated lower glucocorticoid levels says engh
human research results highlight importance friendly social relationships reducing stress
female baboons usually one two close female friends usually devote large proportion grooming seem enjoy spending time close together
engh also mentions friendships form male female baboons relationships female often grooms male male protects female infants might predation bullying baboons

censoring scientists justified according csiro scientists say theyve banned talking public aspects climate change
allegations australian government pressured top scientists keep quiet implications climate change tip iceberg scientific censorship commentators say
according claims aired abc tvs four corners program last night senior csiro scientists drs graeme pearman barney foran barrie pittock regularly gagged commenting socalled policy issues greenhouse gas emission targets environmental refugees
least one expert says times government censorship scientific research justified may necessary
dr michael selgelid lecturers bioethics university sydney questions whether scientists able publish research could endanger public
example information could used make nuclear weapons censored weve living last 60 years says
says governments similarly able block publication research provides information making biological weapons
someone discovers easy way making something thats dangerous contagious smallpox would really good grounds censoring despite fact free speech important scientific openness important
disagrees suggestions matter journals censor publish scientists censor
scientists dont kind expertise sometimes government thats going information thats needed risk assessment says
vested interests
censorship different matter comes influence vested interests says brian martin associate professor science technology society university wollongong published articles suppression dissent science
says form censorship alive well australia
studies thing stands cases become prominent every one theses least 10 maybe many 100 cases never receive publicity says
dr mark diesendorf former csiro chief scientist senior lecturer environment studies university new south wales
accuses csiro gagging 1970s 80s involved renewable energy research
says history repeating latest allegations csiros recent decision move away renewable energy research
everyone csiro terrified federal government cut budget unless exactly theyre told suppression atmospheric research scientists well know us work energy policy field says
spokeswoman csiro declined comment saying dont think possibly comment something happened 20 years ago
also describes diesendorfs comments fear budget cuts absolute rubbish
withholding funding
diesendorf says withholding funding another form censorship many research grants subject ministerial approval describes unequal funding cooperative reserch centres crcs
three crcs fossil fuels zero renewable energy says
research development solar energy shrunk funding windpower
diesendorf says hes particularly worried describes blatant muzzling scientists
says means risk policy decisions made vested interests big business military powerful professions
scientists people expert knowledge means policy decisions made without expert knowledge expert knowledge vested interests says
least expect democracy sides right present evidence thats relevant policy
martin says worried scientific censorship affect human life
climate change talking risk future generations something society paying attention put agenda without fear favour
censorship doesnt appear universal experience scientists

hormonal changes teenage girls go start periods may explain trouble sleeping
adolescent girls appear greater risk insomnia begin menstruation study found
suggests hormonal changes play role developing sleep disorder researchers say journal pediatrics
researchers found among 1000 13 16yearolds study nearly 11 suffered insomnia point
insomnia based formal clinical criteria defined problems falling asleep staying asleep least four times week month longer
typically study found teens started sleep disturbances around age 11
menstruation girls likely boys insomnia
began menstrual periods girls twice risk insomnia boys
findings suggest hormonal changes come menstruation contribute girls insomnia risk according authors
physiological reason one two broad explanations menstruation would related insomnia says lead author dr eric johnson
possibility physical changes come puberty like breast development create social pressures contribute sleep problems says johnson researcher rti international
says menstruation related specifically problems staying asleep getting enough deep sleep
forms insomnia likely physiological causes whereas problems falling asleep first place often stressrelated
addition girls higher risk insomnia explained higher rates depression often marked sleep disturbances
long lasting problem
another key finding johnson says teens ever suffered insomnia 88 also symptoms time study
says signals problem lasting many teenagers
insomnia seems common chronic among adolescents johnson colleagues conclude
given consequences sleep deprivation among teenagers including blunted mental acuity poorer school performance even poorer physical emotional health prevention treatment may need become important priorities researchers say
therapies insomnia include lifestyle changes promote sleep like getting bed rising regular times day cognitive behavioral therapy sleep medications

court making different rules copyright protection online world
record companies given power veto design new digital communication technologies say advocates online civil liberties
claim electronic frontiers australia efa comes eve appeal landmark ruling last year providers internet filesharing software kazaa
kazaa one number free software packages allow people swap files internet
record companies complain peertopeer filesharing software leads people illegally downloading copyrighted music
last year took providers kazaa software federal court australia
court found providers guilty authorising copyright infringement encouraging millions users download music artists ranging powderfinger radiohead christine anu robbie williams
court also ordered providers kazaa modify software contain filters would make difficult users search copyrighted works specified record companies
monday 20 february providers kazaa appeal decision efa new south wales council civil liberties australian consumers association applying take part appeal
efa also worried kazaa ruling could one day lead email providers inappropriately monitoring filtering blocking messages
concerns
record companies focus illegal uses peertopeer filesharing software efa worried last years kazaa ruling order modify software hinder people want use legally
says filtering may catch files infringing copyright example music already public domain music deliberately distributed free independent music groups
efa also doesnt think record companies able control design new digital communication technologies
type precedent allowed stand says efa vicechair dale clapperton essentially going give record labels veto power development new technology
australian recording industry association aria disagrees
noone read judgement could form view aria spokesperson says operators kazaa even suggest
aria also rejects claims filters stop legitimate downloads
wellconstructed filter targets infringing files effect legitimate files kazaa system aria spokesperson says
new precedent
clapperton says last years kazaa ruling shows court treating online copyright infringement different way past infringements
says court first found australian university library guilty authorising copyright infringement allowing students photocopy books ruled libraries put warning signs
court didnt ban photocopiers didnt order photocopiers modified reduce potential used infringing purposes says clapperton
similarly says video recorder banned movie studios complained could used infringe copyright taping television programs
theyd succeeded wouldnt video machines today would almost certainly things like ipods
stifling innovation
efa says early days digital communication software providers made responsible product used could reduce competition
could end situation people produce products ones already tied music labels says clapperton
really going stifle development new technologies
aria rejects claims
evidence reduction competition innovation following decision says spokesperson opposite happened launch many digital download services including itunes
possible impacts
efa chair matt black adamant kazaa case overturned precedent could affect email providers instant messaging even google
black says software like gmail capacity large files transferred via internet principle kazaa ruling applied may see google runs gmail filtering email
youre looking situation important communications monitored filtered potentially blocked inappropriately email provider
theres flow water terraces like meets mathematicians eye
mathematical equation attempts model distribution water rice terraces convinced one researcher western notion maths lot learn cultures
mathematician willy alangui university philippines baguio spoke attempt model rice terrace irrigation week third international conference ethnomathematics auckland new zealand
alangui studying irrigation network rice paddy terraces built indigenous kankanaey people northern philippines
im trying understand water efficiently distributed paddies says alangui
paddies contained stone walls farmers ensure everyone gets enough water opening closing inlets outlets water flows top terraces bottom
alangui developed equation model dynamics water distribution
model took account variables amount water flowing system rate evaporation size elevation paddies
mathematician explained nicely dynamics goes distribution water whole network paddies says
went back validate variables used kankanaey people found model seriously flawed
failed account one major factor governs kankanaey rice irrigation system ethic cooperation
social responsibility factor
alangui found system depended notion social responsibility
even water scarce people upstream shared water equally downstream helped build irrigation system first place
told system would fail paddy owner top hill took water fair
alangui says failure model capture ethical dimension irrigation system told needed broaden perspective mathematician
phd thesis alangui try modify model include ethic although says may possible
mathematics may deficient says end everything one way looking world
ethnomathematics
alangui thinks western mathematics lot learn cultures hence interest ethnomathematics connections mathematics culture
says western mathematics become powerful arrogant field marginalised perspectives
maori culture example different concept numbers says alangui western culture uses number three adjective example phrase three glasses maori talk glasses interacting act threeing
kankanaey culture says concept circle static object defined centre radius rather concept encircling circle defined point moving around circumference
alangui says mathematicians ask static version numbers circles come dominate interrogating longheld assumptions like could lead different useful concepts maths says
says hyperbolic elliptic geometry developed mathematicians questioned assumption euclidian geometry two parallel lines never meet

light saturns rings illuminates storm lightning strikes 1000 powerful ones earth
nearly month huge storm massive lightning raging saturn watchful eye cassini spacecraft
cassini ear radio receiver first detected storm 23 january week scientists finally coaxed image cassinis camera
sunlight reflecting planets rings provided enough light saturn night cassinis camera pick storm cloud features
researchers working hard identify spots within storm could lightning
place solar system besides earth lightning positively identified jupiter
cassinis radio detector time says planetary meteorologist professor andrew ingersoll california institute technology member cassini science team
months go radio noise saturn sudden space day get thats happened 23 january
radio emissions similar popping crackling might hear driving thunderstorm radio
generally thought radio interference actually radio waves generated lightning
behind storm
scientists sure causes lighting saturn believe triggered process creates lightning earth
earth think convection thunderstorms important process separating positive charges negative charges separate enough charges build large potential field separated charges says university iowas dr bill kurth deputy principal investigator cassinis radio plasma wave science instrument
nature doesnt like tries correct situation running current two separated charges forms large spark theres awful lot energy thats released meant basically allow negative charges positive charges get back together kurth says
saturn phenomena manifests gigantic scale lighting bolts 1000 times stronger strikes earth radio data reveals storm spans area larger continental us
saturn massive storms mystery planet gets 1 sunlight reaches earth much less energy drive storms ingersoll says
given two possibilities one number storms earth weaker two strong fewer
studies needed ingersoll favours second explanation
storm certainly looks vigorous radio emissions powerful deep may water atmosphere earth ingersoll says
amateurs beat professionals
first images storm actually came two groundbased amateur astronomers cassini spacecraft
present orbital perch cassini unable image sunlit side saturn
team studying radio emissions however decided ask amateur astronomy community anyone pictures saturn corresponded radio emissions coming
within hours two astronomers near paris submitted first visual confirmation storm

poultry farmers burn chicken carcasses nigeria country started investigating suspected human cases h5n1 bird flu virus scientists preparing worstcase scenario human bird flu pandemic
human vaccine deadly h5n1 strain bird flu virus successfully passed first stages testing safety effectiveness reports manufacturer
trial carried murdoch childrens research institute university melbourne royal adelaide hospital recently tested vaccine made csl ltd melbourne
csl today announced vaccine triggered immune response predicts equate good level protection half 400 healthy adult volunteers tested
says dr andrew cuthbertson csls chief scientific officer participants got little odd sore arm
reassuring safety sense
vaccine based deactivated virus originally taken vietnamese patient
grown fertilised chicken eggs killed mixed aluminium phosphate adjuvant given volunteers
cuthbertson says trial found immune stimulation occurred two antigen doses 75 microgram two 15 micrograms although greater stimulation occurred double 15 microgram dose dose used normal flu shots
generally assumed higher immune stimulation greater protection cuthbertson says one knows yet precisely immune level protect
safety efficacy studies
csl says plans organise second trial study safety effectiveness vaccine 800 healthy volunteers particular children older people respond differently vaccines
also plans test impact higher doses vaccine clarify dose gives best immune response
hopes vaccine could registered time first half 2007
says cuthbertson vaccine eventually registered matter governments regulatory agencies decide lowest dose protect number people
ready
csl says bird flu pandemic arrived directed government would able produce vaccine six weeks
pandemic strain mutated h5n1 strain readily transmitted humans says time frame could stretched
virus different would proceed crank much vaccine possible one made already says cuthbertson
different csl would switch making new vaccine would take another six weeks
cuthbertson says registering vaccine h5n1 strain still save time even eventual pandemic strain different therapeutic goods administration told csl would repeat clinical trials
making assumption safety profile forth similar says
trials
many attempts make vaccine around world results clinical trials announced says professor aileen plant chief executive officer australian biosecurity cooperative research centre curtin university consultant world health organization
exciting really dont think theres anywhere else thats able get sort immunological response two doses 15 micrograms says plant also sits federal governments national influenza pandemic action committee
says us trial last year use adjuvant give substantially antigen get immune response means fewer people could vaccinated
plant agrees vaccine could used emergency despite missing data children elderly people
pandemic came tomorrow risks would high would say worth going even didnt data
researchers put insulin producing cells like tiny capsules treatment type 1 diabetes
encapsulating insulin producing cells tiny seaweed bubbles injecting people type 1 diabetes could one day remove need daily insulin injections australian researcher says
professor bernie tuch university new south wales launched trial technology week using capsules made seaweed derivative alginate measuring 300 micrometres across
tuch says trial works mean insulin producing cells islets transplanted effectively reversing type 1 diabetes without need immunosuppressive drugs
capsules protect transplanted cells sought destroyed bodys immune system
capsules also contain tiny holes let insulin flow allowing oxygen nutrients
concept seaweed forms coating around islets holes small enough prevent immune cells entering tuch says
trial involving 51year woman diagnosed type 1 diabetes 40 years ago first kind australia
tuchs team diabetes transplant unit sydneys prince wales hospital previously tested method animals
italian group began similar human trial two years ago using capsules made different material
75000 capsules
mondays halfhour procedure woman injected 75000 capsules containing total around 200000 islet cells
islets isolated cadaver put capsules procedure tuch compares blowing soap bubbles
theres alginate theres cells theres air says
blow air alginate cells together like blowing soap bubbles come cells inside capsules
capsules injected patients abdomen hoped start producing insulin within 24 hours allowing slowly begin reducing insulin injections
tuch says one injection could potentially last lifetime although yet known whether current patient need extra injections
could go wrong
immunologist dr bronwyn obrien working team university technology sydney genetically engineer liver cells produce insulin says tuchs method promising may complications
practice one big problems often islets centre capsule become hypoxic theyre getting oxygen die says
implications would cells would break possibly small enough pieces could leave capsule
theres also chance immune cells could grow around outside capsules blocking flow insulin says
pores capsules big enough keep cells antibodies theres still chance cytokines socalled messengers immune system slip produce inflammatory response
tuch acknowledges risk says patient received antiinflammatory drugs precaution
dont anticipate going major inflammatory response get islets may destroyed says
diabetes
concept microencapsulation means avoiding rejection drugs could apply transplant involving cells tuch says particular stem cell therapies
concept using capsules certainly something reaching clinical testing time tell offer says

leaves jagged edges like maple leaves allow better uptake nutrients start growing season temperatures cooler
leaves toothed edges help trees shrubs plants cope cold us researchers say
studying leaves ancient existing plants could help reveal past present climates say current isssue international journal plant sciences
say climates critical determining periods global warming profound temperature changes
dr dana royer authored study dr peter wilf pennsylvania state university says jagged pointy edges leaves packed xylem tissue transports water nutrients sap
liquid evaporates leaving teeth minuscule pores
springtime leaves starting leaf leaves teeth average losing water leaves without teeth says royer assistant professor earth environmental sciences wesleyan university
loss water helps pull sap roots thus trees toothed leaves probably higher rate sap flow early spring toothless leaves
important delivers nutrients developing leaves helping jumpstart photosynthetic season move colder colder climates shorter shorter growing seasons becomes increasingly beneficial teeth adds
transpires
researchers measured moisture evaporation transpiration photosynthesis activity leaves 60 woody species two regions differing climates pennsylvania north carolina
determined energygathering activity transpiration increased jagged leaf edges 45 first 30 days spring growing season leaves without teeth exhibit marked increase
scientists also found plants native colder climates like pennsylvanias south central york county toothy edges especially active
possessing teeth may always advantageous leaves since teeth also promote water loss plants drier regions seem better fewer teeth toothless
everyone agrees

physicians middle ages inspected urine holding light
colour urine tell lot health says researcher whos concerned modern medicine overlooking time honoured diagnostic tool
australian researcher says ancient practice examining patients urine could help doctors monitor medication pinpoint disease cases avoid costly invasive tests
dr carole foot intensive care specialist queenslands prince charles hospital publishes paper calls uroscopic rainbow postgraduate medical journal
ancient greeks first diagnosed rare blood disorder porphyria observing colourful urine even named illness greek word purple
middle ages urine analysis enjoyed heyday specimens routinely examined matula urine glass held light
foot says urine analysis could help today
says idea paper hit ward round discovering number patients discoloured urine
highly sophisticated monitoring devices tell us sorts things critically ill patients something old fashioned looking urine says
urine hospital
foot says urine provide information whether patients taking certain medications overadministered
example propofol common sedative critical care wards turns urine pink given right dose green patients getting much
thats signal us think reducing amount propofol giving says
antibiotic rifampicin used adjunct antibiotics sometimes treatment tuberculosis turns urine secretions including tears orange means properly absorbed
take sample urine orange know patients taking tablets foot says
certainly used agent monitor compliance
using urine diagnose disease
dark brown tea coloured urine indicate infection patients undergone heart valve operations suggests patient haemolysing breaking red cells
urine turns black exposed air also sign alkaptonuria rare enzyme disorder causes abnormalities skin cartilages gout produce pink urine
foot says ways diagnosing conditions today
whats interesting way lot conditions came diagnosed based people back middle ages noticing abnormalities urine
using urine rule problems
looking urine also help rule serious complications
foot says gp sees patient red urine may jump conclusions something sinister
red urine points bleeding blood urine almost always means something abnormal
simple question could make clear urine red patient menstruating
eating beetroot blackberry rhubarb also turn peoples urine red bluegreen urine also sign patient drinking much mouthwash
ive seen people worked complex problems didnt ask patient something simple foot says
urine look like
healthy person urine ranges colour almost clear bright yellow pigment known urochrome
urochrome becomes concentrated urine go dark yellow brownish suggests time drink
marker hydration used marker whether youre drinking enough fluid particularly summer foot says
urine inspection isnt always failproof says individual urine ph levels genetic factors influence whether certain substances discolour

single high impact tropical cyclone event 2004 2005 directly attributed global warming says report submitted world meteorological organizations wmo commission atmospheric sciences meeting south africa
dr john mcbride principal research scientist australias bureau meteorology reports wmo effects climate change tropical weather
also chair international wmo committee produced report
mcbride says report came attempt separate fact fiction relation recent controversy role climate change producing tropical cyclones
mcbride says theres doubt latest season ferocious recent times series vicious cyclones including hurricane katrina devastated new orleans
last two years probably severe since satellite era began 40 years ago says
says evidence linking climate change inconclusive lacking
case climate change
current argument suggests climate change causes seas warm oceans store energy harnessed wind form tropical cyclones
simplistic mcbride says
conditions necessary able tap energy source structure wind systems says
mcbride says theres proof cyclones become common become frequent future theyll take place parts world
worldwide theres really evidence change says
says report also questions claims tropical cyclones become intense past 50 years saying data used past may inaccurate incomplete limitations technology day

genes govern aspects social communication human bonding spirituality help determine whether youll make good dancer research suggests
professional dancers born least two special genes give leg rest us according new study
recent research also suggested intelligence athletic ability musical talent linked genes brain hardwiring
dancing added list evidence indicates certain individuals born predisposition specific behaviours talents least qualities may represent evolved attributes
think dancing evolved trait says professor richard ebstein led study published recent issue plos genetics journal
animals courtship dances think human dancing represents development ancient animal trait says ebstein psychology professor hebrew universitys scheinfeld center genetic studies
also fact dancing universal existed human societies even communities man separated geographically tens thousands years aboriginal australians native americans africans eurasians attests early origin dance evolution species
first find dancers
ebstein doctoral student rachel bachnermelman colleagues examined dna 85 currently performing dancers parents
thing 91 competitive athletes 872 people neither regularly dance often participate sports
scientists discovered dancers tend possess variants two genes involved transmission information nerve cells
one identified genes transporter serotonin brain transmitter contributes spiritual experience
second receptor hormone vasopressin many studies suggest modulates social communication human bonding
people born dance says ebstein genes partially contribute musical talent coordination sense rhythm however genes studied related emotional side dancing need ability communicate people spiritual side natures enable feel music communicate feeling others via dance
ebstein believes adults may possess special gene variants perhaps never nurtured related skills recognised hidden talent
many us surely ability hundred reasons never exploited particular talent says
ebstein explained identified genes seem linked every form dancing tap hula since usually involve social communication connecting music rhythms
factors consider

mount vesuvius volcano buried pompeii nearby towns 79ad could erupt far violently us italian volcanologists discovered
based evidence powerful earlier eruption scientists say event could destroy villages kill people far 25 kilometres summit
dr giuseppe mastrolorenzo vesuvius observatory italy professor michael sheridan university buffalo new york colleagues found compelling evidence nearly 4000 years ago vesuvius produced devastating eruption
event called avellino catastrophe destroyed area presentday naples making bronze age farmers flee lives
researchers first examined wellpreserved remains nola village 15 kilometres northeast volcano
digging ash layer left eruption found evidence sudden en masse evacuation

one kilometre east nola mastrolorenzos team found skeletons man woman buried metre volcanic debris dramatic evidence unlucky escape attempt death due suffocation
eruption probably preceded warning blast 36 kilometre column ash gas would spewed high atmosphere rained covering 20 kilometres
scientists believe 10000 inhabitants area probably survived eruption indeed found thousands footprints made ash leading away volcano
archaeological evidence indicates people returned tried set settlements
vain attempt deposit millions cubic metres ash small pumice fragments made area uninhabitable hundreds years
got know vesuvius much better know pompeii doesnt represent worstcase scenario anymore says mastrolorenzo
need incorporate data prehistoric eruption hazard plan extreme scenario could impact city naples surroundings
eruption similar avellino catastrophe today would affect area much larger actual danger red zone comprises population 600000 18 towns squashed within 6 kilometre radius volcano sea
indeed least 3 million people live within area destroyed avellino eruption
computer modelling shows within radius least 12 kilometres volcano impact force sedimentation rate pyroclastic surge would cause total devastation mortality inferred dynamic overpressure surge clouds would exceed even building strength say researchers
15 kilometres away volcano people would survive though would still risk suffocating fine dust cloud
volcanic crisis start quickly leaving weeks months planning important use available data forecast scale potential events mastrolorenzo says
catastrophes often caused extreme events
cycle eruptions
vesuvius active volcano european mainland erupts dramatically cycles
according sheridan may high probability events like avellino eruption pompeii eruption occur near future italian authorities must still consider possibilities
bronze age eruption 4000 years ago 2000 years ago 79ad event seems every 2000 years theres major eruption scale vesuvius says sheridan
using standard statistical test 50 chance violent eruption happen vesuvius next year year goes statistical probability increases says

existing remote telecommunication networks struggling cope todays internet traffic according one expert new decentralised network
remote communities could access cheaper wireless broadband services city cousins via newgeneration mobile phones computers say australian researchers
devices could also part local community telecommunication networks independent major centralised networks researchers add
dr mehran abolhasan university wollongong heading team trial new technology remote western australian community later year
remote communities still rely outdated technologies lowcapacity networks really able provide todays internet traffic says abolhasan telecommunications computer engineering expert
one main reasons enormous cost rolling links latest communications hubs cities
low population remote areas means return investment quite low
despite government subsidies australia example remote communities pay get access telecommunications people city often least likely able afford
ad hoc networks
abolhasan hopes lowcost alternative providing uptodate telecommunications remote communities
team developing new software hardware run called ad hoc networks
key components networks small portable computer devices pcs mobile phones transmit well receive microwave signals
ability transmit means well pc mobile phone devices act nodes communication network
put top towers transmit messages long distances especially number linked chain
ad hoc networking cheap low cost technology enables wireless communication different units says abolhasan much open source software already freely available
remote communities would access broadbandtype service low price says cheaper current broadband services city
says ad hoc networks another advantage centralised devices break communicate units reroute messages
extending existing networks
abolhasan says ad hoc networking extend range existing infrastructure
example remote community central building access satellite network extend satellite network individual homes
technology could also used enable communications within community example people could run broadband television station local community centre
community private network without going infrastructure says abolhasan
main research challenge increase capacity technology moment unable service large numbers people time says
team plans trial ad hoc networking indigenous community western australia second half year
works outback australia work anywhere says abolhasan

alrt based university erlangennuremburg germany stresses supporting ocean sequestration investigation option help stop global warming
arlts speciality includes science separating different chemicals co2 air calls ocean sequestration natural option
nature already says look total emissions carbon dioxide one part stored air part dissolved ocean
oceans earths main buffer system says
says increased concentration co2 atmosphere led increased amounts gas dissolved surface ocean turn led increase ocean acidity harmful marine life
going deeper
says arlt initial calculations suggest ocean sequestration significantly increase acidity oceans long co2 injected deep ocean mixed across whole planet
arlt says co2 injected downwelling areas ocean dissolved form tend stay bottom ocean mixed deep ocean currents across planet
says one modelling exercise suggests co2 injected near europe distributed far australia 100 years time
arlt says predicts effect ocean acidity using method would small would unmeasurable would affect sea life ocean bottom thinks investigated
says another option neutralise co2 sequestering oceans mixing alkaline minerals limestone
ipcc warns ocean acidification
recent report co2 capture storage intergovernmental panel climate change ipcc canvasses options ocean sequestration include arlts argument
report says ocean sequestration could help lock co2 hundreds years deeper injection effective shallower injection
warns increased acidity ocean surface harm marine organisms
report mention arlts point downwelling waters deep ocean currents
alrt says ipcc wanted coauthor report time problems contribute
ideas inside report says
ipcc report notes effect increased co2 deep ocean yet studied
whole range options
australian coauthor ipcc report dr peter cook chief executive cooperative research centre greenhouse gas technologies agrees little known ocean sequestration research always good
going need whole range options decreasing co2 emissions says
says ipcc took cautious view future ocean sequestration
careful great deal information cook says

humpback whales structured songs phrases themes noone knows mean
humpback whales sing songs contain elements human language according detailed new analysis whale songs recorded hawaii
researchers yet believe whales language per se discovered striking similarities human language songs humpback whales megaptera novaeangliae
lead researcher ryuji suzuki says humans whales communicate using discrete sound units arranged within hierarchical structure
example text consists paragraphs paragraph consists sentences sentence consists clauses etc says suzuki massachusetts institute technology
different levels hierarchy layers
terms humpback songs song session consists songs song consists themes theme consists phrases phrase consists units
put together elements indicate whales something akin syntax normally refers grammatical arrangement words within sentences
findings published months journal acoustical society america
suzuki colleagues designed computer program converted tiny sections whale songs mathematical symbols
analysed average amount information conveyed symbol technique called information theory quantifies complexity structure
information context information theory include meaning focuses rare surprising predictable complex message suzuki explains
listening whale song
human observers previous knowledge whale song structure grouped humpback whale recordings complexity redundancy predictability
computer analysis human observers found whale songs hierarchical convey around one bit information per second
comparison humans generate 10 bits information variance every word spoken
spoken vowel syllable example contains least bits data correspond different sounds produced speaker
one versus 10 may sound impressive whales communicate water often long distances water helps transmit songs carries sound four times faster air
using information theory
jennifer miksisolds research associate university massachusetts dartmouths school marine science technology one people world also using information theory study whale songs
agree new findings currently using information theory analyse humpback whale communication come similar conclusions miksisolds says
agrees marine mammal songs sounds cannot classified present language suzuki admit yet understand meaning whale songs research needed

power poles damaged cyclone larry hit northern australia last month cyclones lot worse says one expert
cyclones like larry intense think says cyclone risk engineer
dont get forecasts right says australia could left unprepared worst
dr bruce harper queenslandbased consultant long association bureau meteorology says cyclone larry hit northern town innisfail recently powerful people think
says bureau predicted cyclone would hit land category 5 cyclone winds around 290 kilometres per hour closest weather stations showed lot weaker
harper says station south johnstone 7 kilometres innisfail showed wind speeds 180 kilometres per hour
maximum speeds recorded nearest offshore station flinders reef measured 240 kilometres per hour
measurements fall within definition category 4 cyclone
estimation low category 4 says harper also advises local state governments cyclone risk insurers estimated losses cyclones
wasnt 290 kilometres per hour would barely house standing parts innisfail says
community needs know cyclones lot worse
inaccuracy significant
gary foley bureau meteorology melbourne acknowledges cyclone weaker predicted
says data actual wind speed probably calculated 40 50 kilometres per hour less predicted
translate person making response storm hits put couple nails roof something
harper acknowledges bureau helped people prepare severe cyclone keen emphasise agency best technology resources says difference 50 kilometres per hour could huge impact damage
also thinks even final estimates made bureau still overestimating strength larry says overestimates present broader problems
higher lower estimates
harper says predictions cyclone intensities cant accurately verified arent enough weather stations collecting data strong winds really hit land
says cyclone risk engineers like use closest weather station measurements along actual damage caused cyclones make estimates strengths cyclones hit land
information used build models help develop building authorities specify standards cycloneproof houses
models help insurance companies work much money need keep aside cyclone damage payouts
harper says estimates cyclone risk engineers almost always lower provided meteorological predictions
concerned widely publicised overestimates bureau might lead public complacency
could give people false impression cyclone impacts downplay importance building cycloneresistant buildings says
uncertainties
harper says one reasons bureau overestimating strength cyclones huge uncertainties measurements
says satellite technology use measure cloud temperature proxy wind speed outdated
doesnt take consideration fact cyclones change rapidly fact size cyclone affect intensity says
harper says bureau radar measure actual wind speed possibly fly aircraft cyclones collect data occurs us
many weather stations around country predictions easily verified models adjusted accordingly
bureaus foley agrees given funds better technology weather stations would give accurate predictions doubts would worth cost
appreciates engineers like harper would like weather stations says bureau cant expected things people given uncertainty exists would rather err side caution
chemical composition sun appears different assumed analysis moon soil revealed
analysis first sample lunar soil collected neil armstrong thrown disarray researchers believe sun international team scientists says
dr trevor ireland australian national university colleagues report journal nature today results study oxygen isotopes surface soil grains returned earth 1969 apollo 11 mission
hoped study would provide clues chemical makeup sun protoplanetary soup gave birth solar system
particular researchers hoped find evidence either two reigning theories suns composition
according one theory sun similar oxygen composition planets
theory suggests enriched levels isotope oxygen16
instead study indicates sun dissimilar bodies like earth meteorites lower levels oxygen16 expected
completely unexpected result us ireland says sun sun thought
finding also suggests sun somehow ended different composition cloud dust gas preceded ireland says
says based small rocky bodies known carbonate chondrites oldest known things solar system 500 times oxygen16 oxygen isotopes
solar winds
ireland says cant get samples directly sun infer composition looking lunar samples believed reflect composition
lunar soil contains oxygen isotopes implanted solar winds carrying elements blown sun
using caesium beam erode surface soil grains measure isotopes oxygen16 oxygen17 oxygen18 researchers discovered unexpectedly low levels oxygen16

vietnams fight bird flu
humans infected bird flu appear virus throat nose people standard human influenza strains conference due hear today
findings may help explain avian influenza h5n1 high death rate humans 50 mortality
dr menno de jong head virology department university oxfords clinical research unit hospital tropical diseases ho chi minh city studied 17 patients bird flu
found virus often associated disseminated infection blood faeces higher levels viral replication nasopharynx compared contemporary vietnamese influenza cases
high viral levels disseminated infection intense inflammatory response also seem associated poor outcomes due tell australasian society infectious diseases annual scientific meeting wellington new zealand today
main findings influenza h5n1 seems characterised high virus levels respiratory tract evidence suggesting disseminated infection virus detection blood rectum likely result intense inflammatory response de jong says
high levels viral replication likely play role determining patients outcome direct effects virus inflammatory response virus says
reason high mortality probably high replication rates per se high replication rates extremely virulent virus says
antiviral drugs started early prevent much inflammatory response possible says
two people study developed resistance antiviral drug oseltamivir died reported new england journal medicine last december
resistance implies suboptimal suppression replication strategies minimise include ensuring adequate levels drug body increasing dose giving intravenously combining antiviral drugs says
de jong says aviantype cell receptors mostly lower respiratory tract could explain bird flu spread among humans reported journal nature recently
may explain viral load seems higher throat nose infected developed pneumonia says
cockroaches make decisions group new research shows
cockroaches govern simple democracy insect equal standing group consultations precede decisions affect entire group indicates new study
research determines cockroach decisionmaking follows predictable pattern could explain group dynamics insects animals ants spiders fish even cows
cockroaches silent creatures save perhaps sound scurrying countertop must therefore communicate without vocalising
cockroaches use chemical tactile communication says dr joseacute halloy coauthored research current proceedings national academy sciences
also use vision says halloy scientist department social ecology free university brussels belgium
encounter recognise belong colony thanks antennae nooses sophisticated olfactory organs sensitive says
give shelter
halloy tested cockroach group behaviour placing insects dish contained three shelters test see cockroaches would divide shelters
much consultation antenna probing touching cockroaches divided perfectly
example 50 insects placed dish three shelters capacity 40 bugs 25 roaches huddled together first shelter 25 gathered second shelter third left vacant
researchers altered setup three shelters capacity 50 insects cockroaches moved first house
delicate balance
halloy colleagues found balance existed cooperation competition resources
cockroaches gregarious insects benefit living groups increases reproductive opportunities promotes sharing resources like shelter food prevents desiccation aggregating dry environments etc says
show behavioural models allow optimise group size
models predictable could explain insect animal group behaviours fish bugs divide neatly subgroups certain herding animals make simple decisions involve leadership
important research
dr david sumpter university oxford zoologist says new study excellent paper important
looks mechanisms underlying decisionmaking animals mechanisms produce distribution animals amongst resource sites optimises individual fitness says
much previous research concentrated either mechanisms optimality expense
cockroaches seems cooperation comes naturally

astronomers found methanol cloud w3oh region milky way stars form
astronomers say spotted cloud alcohol space measures 463 billion kilometres across finding could shed light giant stars formed primordial gas
vast bridgeshaped cloud methanol spotted region milky way called w3oh stars form gravitational collapse concentrations gas dust
researchers led dr lisa harveysmith spotted cloud uks jodrell bank observatory
present findings today meeting uks royal astronomical society leicester
researchers revealed giant filaments gas detecting masers
like lasers rather emitting beams light masers emit beams microwave radiation molecules gas cloud amplify millions times
largest maser filaments detected using merlin radio telescope 463 billion kilometres long
researchers say entire gas cloud seems rotating disc around central star like accretion discs planets form around young stars
harveysmith says discovery surprising researchers thought masers pointlike objects small bright hotspots surrounded fainter halos
2004 astronomers spotted methanol first time one disclike clusters form around nascent stars
discovery opened new area debate astrophysics challenging conventional view interstellar chemistry could provide conditions creating complex molecules
researchers thought molecules would ripped apart ultraviolet radiation stars tough conditions

giving antiviral drugs treatment infected people prophylaxis close contacts provides best chance minimising impact bird flu pandemic new research suggests
australian study found targeted prophylaxis would delay onset pandemic buying time hopefully develop distribute vaccine
treatmentbased strategy would significantly delay onset disease reduce attack rate federal governmentfunded study found
study dr james mccaw dr jodie mcvernon university melbourne may considered health authorities avian influenza h5n1 reaches australia
mccaw theoretical physicist mcvernon paediatrician research fellow used mathematical model determine optimal use australias stockpile 4 million doses antiviral drugs pandemic
model examines differences using antivirals treatment person bird flu reduce chance dying transmission using drugs postexposure prophylaxis come contact infectious person
model says every time new person becomes ill 20 contacts need tracked given antivirals mccaw told australasian society infectious diseases annual scientific meeting new zealand week
research indicates average typical person 20 close contacts people days 85 relatives friends work colleagues 15 others shopkeepers bus driver
researchers defined close contact someone twoway conversation within metre infected person

researchers said rna material 1918 virus obtained preserved tissue victims pandemic showed similar bird viruses including deadly h5n1 strain concern today
taubenberger team also said argument supported family trees constructed comparing particular 1918 virus genes equivalent genes broad range viruses found animals
gibbs disagrees taubenbergers interpretation virus family trees
says true 1918 h1n1 strain originated birds distant past question
recombination mammals
taubenberger argues 1918 virus came directly birds without combining viruses animals first
gibbs says family trees show 1918 virus evolved virus already mammals time
says fact get different family tree depending virus gene used construct supports idea 1918 virus result virus recombination animals like pigs horses cats
gibbs also says virus may humans 50 60 years pandemic suggested studies showing elderly people immunity 1918 flu
suspects coincidence 1918 bird flu viruses taubenberger studied similar citing phenomenon known parallel evolution
wings evolved insects birds mammals reptiles says havent evolved common ancestor wings theyve evolved wings independently
happens flu well fact probably common flu well understood
focus birds
gibbs says taubenbergers linking bird flu 1918 pandemic increased alarm bird flu
notion threat influenzas comes birds actually quite wrong says
reasonable chance next pandemic may come influenza virus already people pigs mammal says

female australian redback spider eating male spider
australian redback spiders sniff much competition females theyre growing tailor adult size accordingly say canadian researchers
michael kasumovic dr maydianne andrade university toronto report findings latest issue journal current biology
males really tracking selection pressures theyre facing environment theyre aware male density amount competition theyre going facing says kasumovic
like spiders male redback spiders much smaller females vary size
kasumovic andrade found individual spiders development determined tradeoff traits benefit spiders sexual success versus longer term survival
trait thats good sex often good surviving trait thats good surviving may good sex says australian spider expert dr marie herberstein macquarie university sydney
classic example male peacocks tail says good attracting females weighs affects chances survival pursued predator
says kasumovic andrade found comes redbacks maturing early good sexual success maturing later better survival
study
kasumovic andrade studied immature male redbacks develop presence absence females
found females around males develop sexually mature adults slowly growing relatively large adults lots energy stores
gives male spiders higher chance survival set search female mates researchers say
male spiders surrounded females focus energy maturing quickly ending smaller leaner spent less time foraging
kasumovic andrade say growing fast gives spiders best chance first mate nearby females something important considering sex life redbacks
males redbacks one two chances mate killed female mating successful female virgin
everybody always states small males byproduct able get enough resources showing theyre intentionally developing way says kasumovic
small fat
researchers found females males around male redbacks also grow fast small fat stores body males around
researchers suspect extra fat gives males endurance compete males extended courtship rituals females prefer
males supposed pluck vibrate females web strings eight hours hope gaining favour
experiment males could see touch females males around means spiders responding pheromones literally sniffing mates potential competition
choice strategy
herberstein says new research shows male spiders choose strategy pursue depending assess environment theyre maturing
developmental plasticity males tailor development depending situation find says

graffiti modern equivalent cave art expert says produced young men adrenaline sex minds
testosteronefuelled boys created prehistoric cave art according book one worlds authorities type art
theory contradicts idea adult tribal shaman spiritual leaders healers produced virtually
also explains many images drawn caves pleistocene 10000 35000 years ago somewhat mirror todays artwork graffiti largely produced adolescent males
today boys draw testosterone subjects hot automobile fighter jet jedi armour sports direct missile hit etc things associate adrenaline success says professor r dale guthrie author nature paleolithic art
think full larder success excitement danger killing giant bison auroch pleistocene equivalent testosterone art today says guthrie emeritus professor institute arctic biology university alaska fairbanks
says many cave art images animals rather graphic showing example speared animals blood pouring mouths noses
hunting animals things cave artists minds
guthrie also noticed males drawn defined sexual parts save simple line designating penis men even represented images women caves tell different story
female images dominate nude almost every one fullfigured says guthrie
unlike animals sculpted engraved painted human females female parts sometimes done schematically distilling inflating primary secondary sex characters
learning draw
guthrie also determines several cave art images incomplete overlapping brief rudimentary though people created still learning draw
type sketching dominates cave walls also display handful works appear drawn wellpracticed artists probably adults
perhaps convincing piece evidence new theory consists 200 handprints left caves next art
prints produced people chewed ochre held hand spit colorful orangeyellow spew hand leaving wall imprint
guthrie analysed handprints compared results earlier research male female hands
hand lengths palm widths finger widths lengths mostly match hands would belonged boys aged nine 17
teen female handprints identified caves young male prints common
handprints resulting unintentionally people leaning muddy cave walls well footprints also suggest young boys creating cave art according guthrie
paul martin professor quaternary biogeography university arizona says inclined agree new theory findings
guthrie extraordinary knowledge wild animal ecology globally especially northern hemisphere martin says
addition brings detailed knowledge late pleistocene fossils study cave art finally like many zoologists especially children astute observer human behaviour

findings recently presented annual meeting society experimental biology uk
like controlled falling
walking bipeds quadrupeds like controlled falling step individual leans forward caught outstretched limb
result stage body high slow stage body lower faster usherwood explains
fourlegged animal broadly observed clear motions happen says
passive model makes much easier understand body moves changes speed
model also found walking happens relatively stiff limbs unlike trotting dogs legs function like springs tend bend
true bipeds humans says people put energy extending legs dogs appear power torque around hips similar weight distributed bicycle
dogs particularly older arthritic ones often suffer hip problems two bones within hip region lose normal position abnormal areas grind step
time abnormally shaped bone grow inflammation sets since one condition fuels becomes vicious cycle
usherwood hopes model could help clarify deadly cycle begins worsens eventually may lead improved diagnosis treatment
harvard university scientists come similar conclusions regarding mechanics behind dog walking
russell main concord field station researcher believes dog legs work like two inverted pendulums mechanical energy usually recovered stride
dr david lee professor andy biewener also harvard already built robot resembling headless dog called bigdog uses similar principles
according boston dynamics research group involved project bigdog far trotted 5 kilometres per hour climbed 35deg slope carried 54 kilograms

sex life isnt smiles fireworks sick going rough patch whats normal sex life anyway
consumers marketed drugs premature ejaculation without good evidence medical problem treated australian conference heard week
usbased psychologist sex therapist dr leonore tiefer new york university school medicine told inaugural conference diseasemongering newcastle week premature ejaculation next sexual dysfunction marketed pharmaceutical industry
concerns tiefer says sexual difficulties generally biological problems need medical treatment
theres sickness theres pathology nothing broken says
says men women counselled distressing sexually rapid ejaculation low importance
tiefer says way premature ejaculation marketed condition need treatment hallmarks disease mongering
first says drug companysponsored messages media led growing public awareness premature ejaculation regarded problem experts measuring defining finding cures
messages include helpseeking advertisements urge people ask doctor solutions problem
diseaseawareness campaign full force point says tiefer
whats normal
says result people asking doctors normal speed ejaculation wondering whether meet normal standard
answer thing normal says theres range people quick people slow people middle
says although drugs yet specifically approved treat premature ejaculation doctors treating condition available drugs known slow speed ejaculation
doctors getting lot medical education offlabel uses drugs says articles published conferences organised around drug companypaid people going saying use
tiefer says health science journalists also writing premature ejaculation help available
poorly defined
australian sociologist dr ross morrow university sydney also spoke conference agrees premature ejaculation suspicious condition
condition questionable medical category says adding condition poorly defined
says years attempt define premature ejaculation according amount time lapsed number thrusts occurred ejaculation occurred agreement ever reached
morrow says american psychiatric association defines persistent recurrent ejaculation either man intercourse attempts penetration shortly intercourse begins way distressing partner
says definition relies clinicians judgement whether ejaculation occurring soon
norms changing time
morrow also says norms men ejaculate coitus constantly changing
example says study 1948 alfred kinsey discovered threequarters men ejaculated within two minutes coitus regarded acceptable
didnt think dysfunction says morrow actually thought sign men sexually responsive
morrow says 1960s period time ejaculation considered normal experts extended
says coincided belief womens lack sexual satisfaction intercourse could addressed male partner could take longer ejaculate
morrow also says different cultures different norms long men take ejaculate citing case one melanesian culture considers ejaculation 15 30 seconds normal
morrow says australia premature ejaculation often mentioned advertisements discussing erectile dysfunction sometimes referred banner ejaculatory problems
says antidepressant drugs used delay inhibit ejaculation currently used impotency clinics australia sex therapists also treating condition using cognitive behavioural therapy
female premature ejaculation
tiefer morrow also concerned notion rapid orgasm female equivalent premature ejaculation
think part transformation sex subjective experience concrete performance almost like sport rules goals achievement standards says tiefer
define clearly whether performance part way products provided achieve performance ore even exceed expectations
caulobacter crescentus uses stalk stick solid objects
harmless bacteria live rivers produce biological superglue stronger ever measured scientists say
researchers reporting recently proceedings national academy sciences say microorganism caulobacter crescentus sticks surfaces three four times strongly synthetic superglue
bacteria holds secret understanding prevent harmful bacteria sticking human tissue causing disease researchers say
also may help produce nontoxic superglue could used anything dental adhesive industrial glue works underwater surgical glue
advantage bacteria live water bind sorts surfaces water says team member yves brun professor biology indiana university means glue versatile
biologists including brun regularly study c crescentus biological model understanding bacteria function
course experiments brun realised holding power tiny critters attach surfaces stalklike appendage
genes stickiness
zero brun team began genetically manipulating bacteria remove specific genes needed produce adhesive
eventually scientists realised variations c crescentus lacking genes required produce chains sugar molecules ends stalks could hold fast surfaces
scientists determined polysaccharide critical component adhesive
think sugar molecules attached supersticky proteins yet confirm ones
also indirect evidence either adhesive molecules involved polysaccharide somehow modified make stickier says brun
strong glue
researchers however confirm tenacious bacteria
jay tang assistant professor physics brown university team stepped help measure force required pull bacteria flexible glass pipette
researchers found single bacterium could withstand stress 011 226 micronewtons
words amount bacteria fit onto australian 20 cent piece us quarter could withstand pulled force four five tonnes mass adult elephant
team also found enzymes work unglue bacteria surface
work group brown exciting implications better understanding natural adhesives also possible translation new synthetic adhesives says professor dennis discher biophysics polymers lab university pennsylvania
according brun ultimately bacteria would used glue produce adhesive
happen scientists pinpoint genes required devise method getting bacteria produce glue large quantities

hello mr personality researchers learning squid distinct character traits
squid personalities appear passed parent offspring says australian researcher
traits modified environment says dr david sinn present research australasian association study animal behaviour conference sydney week
sinn research fellow university tasmania observed behaviour southern dumpling squid euprymna tasmanica found waters around south australia victoria tasmania
general squid tend solitary unromantic animals propensity cannibalise neighbours take sexual favours force says
within profile sinn found squid shy retiring cautious types others bold assertive adventurous
turns squid bolder others says
example presented threatening stimulus attack stimulus ambivalent
others shyer dont inspect threat back flee
assertiveness training squid
previous research suggests character traits squid 30 hereditary says
theres evidence squid adapt environment learning either temper overconfidence shake shyness
sinn says squid cephalopods like octopuses cuttlefish relatively intelligent relative body size brains size cats
probably compensate loss protective shells evolution says brain capacity needed protect vulnerable bodies predators
population dynamics
sinn says understanding ecology evolution personality provides key understanding drives animal populations
says unclear personality traits confer evolutionary edge although appears mix personalities essential population survive disturbance
individual behaviour going determine far animal population disperses growth rate well survives potentially reproduces things driving population dynamics says
want know predict population abundance maybe need know individual behaviours theyre going react environmental change

neurologists say people whose dreaming spills wakefulness may prone neardeath experiences
brains tendency occasionally blur line sleep wakefulness may help explain phenomenon neardeath experience preliminary research suggests
open question people see bright light feel detached bodies extraordinary sensations close dying believe might die
people view socalled neardeath experiences evidence life death many neurologists considered phenomenon complex scientific study
new research published journal neurology implicates blending sleep wake states biological cause
researchers found adults say theyve experience also likely history whats called rem intrusion aspects dream state sleep spill wakefulness
people may example feel paralysed first wake visual auditory hallucinations fall asleep awaken
55 study participants whove neardeath experience 60 also experienced rem intrusion point lives compares 24 55 adults comparison group
arousing body
findings suggest brains arousal system predisposes people rem intrusion neardeath experience according study authors led dr kevin nelson neurologist university kentucky lexington
arousal system nelson says regulates rem sleep also attention alertness waking hours including dangerous situations
many features rem intrusions says parallel neardeath experience
rem sleep visual centres brain highly active limb muscles temporarily paralysed
rem intrusion peril could promote visions light sensation dead people often neardeath experience according nelson

mainly use tongues hind hooves groom rear end bodies kilgour says
also use inanimate objects like trees branches fence posts stumps get areas cant reach says
theyll walk fallen tree limbs protruding branches groom around eyes says
theyre making finely controlled motor movements groom around sensitive parts body
kilgour tell australasian association study animal behaviour conference sydney week deliberate choice different kinds objects suggests used tools
says bold suggestion definition tool use conventionally relies ability hold manipulate objects
animals cant pick things manipulate nonetheless making decisions going use groom bodies says
im postulating could redefine idea tool use
difficult relate intelligence id like say theres lot going really know
comparisons similar species
kilgour compared grooming behaviour beef cattle undomesticated related species including bison water buffalo banteng eland
found similar grooming patterns
suggests evolutionary purpose grooming kilgour says example maintaining integrity coat may protect invasion parasites bacteria grass seeds
find behaviour occurs closely related species say confers survival advantage animals therefore necessary behaviour says
production systems like feedlots try stop animals grooming dont want push fence posts may thwarting valuable natural behaviour
says attempts prevent grooming may therefore misguided denial animals right express normal behaviour one central elements animal welfare

banning fluoroquinolone class antibiotics animal feed means humans likely respond powerful antibiotics need
reducing use antibiotics foodproducing animals leads less drug resistance humans australian study confirms first time
researchers examined samples 585 people gastroenteritis due nations common bacterial cause foodborne disease campylobacter jejuni
tests identified low level resistance fluoroquinolone group antibiotics australia banned foodproducing animals like poultry
one investigator senior lecturer epidemiology australia national university canberrra dr mahomed patel says flouroquinolones powerful newer generation antibiotics reserved pretty severe infections humans
study found 2 australianacquired campylobacter infections resistant ciprofloxacin type flouroquinolone
countries allow fluoroquinolones used animals ciprofloxacin resistant strains 15 times common humans studies show
drug resistance could make infections hard treat lengthen bouts diarrhoea increase risk serious fatal illness
low level ciprofloxacin resistance c jejuni isolates likely reflects success australias policy restricting use fluoroquinolones foodproducing animals researchers say paper published journal clinical infectious diseases

patel says unknown ciprofloxacin resistance ranged 0 among tasmanian patients 8 infected victorians
expected much higher rates resistance antibiotics among australianacquired infections especially commonly used people community
international evidence

erosion affect rate mountains new zealand grow says researcher
mountains eroded wind rain actually grow larger according canadian geophysicist
associate professor russell pysklywec university toronto says first predict events earths surface affect geological processes hundreds kilometres
pysklywec publishes research erosion affects way tectonic plates collide form mountains current issue journal geology
mountains form number ways including subduction two plates collide edge one plate slides pushing crust process
eventually mountains clog subduction zone pysklywec says change way plates collide subduction zone shifts elsewhere
time original mountains start erode new mountains form elsewhere new subduction zone
wind rain wash away material pushed subduction zone pysklywec says subduction zone get clogged makes easier mountains keep growing
says paradox youd expect erosion wear mountains build
says rate erosion critical
erosion doesnt really lower mountains much typically erosion occurs rate less rate plate convergence says pysklywec developed computer model simulate happens
natural laboratory

hot topic tectonics
australian geophysicist dr wouter schellart australian national university canberra says researchers studying effect erosion tectonic processes geologists debating effect
previous research focused first 30 kilometres earths crust says pysklywecs research shows erosion impact processes deep far hundred kilometres
yet schellart wonders whether latest research applies mountains new zealand
says model doesnt account eroded sediment deposited

imaginary playmates sign rich fantasy life also hint problems researchers say
children imaginary friends vivid daydreams children new study shows first time
australian researcher dr paula bouldin deakin university shows children imaginary friends also tend mythical content dreams
spend time daydreaming ability almost see hear contents daydream front
may appear obvious children imaginary friends richer fantasy life without date little specific research area
bouldin says work reported journal genetic psychology finally provides evidence
questioned 74 children aged three eight half current past imaginary friend
group imaginary friends reported mythical content dreams frequent vivid daydreams likely play games mythical content
imaginary friends turn nasty
dr louise newman child psychiatrist director new south wales institute psychiatry says study confirms long suspected
says research needs look psychological emotional function imaginary friends
newman says imaginary friends function sort super peers perfect playmate also sign emotional disturbance
cases children companions might lonely distressed unable put words things concerning says
friends quite persecutory frightening might torment child express doubts tell theyre stupid bad
newman says imaginary friends quite common younger ages likely associated emotional family problems children age seven
adults imaginary friends
children grow imaginary friends newman says cases imaginary friend emerge adulthood usually response trauma inability cope stress sometimes psychotic illness
rare cases adults develop whats known doppelganger syndrome occurs believe twin invisible friend accompanies
people believe angels guardian angels dont think theres anything ordinary says
bouldin says study suggests children imaginary friends readily access fantasy themes may develop sophisticated information processing skills

genetically modified viruses line conduct electricity could basis new generation batteries
genetically manipulated viruses could replace standard lithiumion batteries packing two three times energy batteries researchers say
virus batteries could thin transparent lightweight according us study published online recently journal science professor angela belcher massachusetts institute technology team
less material devoted packaging battery used generating power
trying mass volume used purpose used power device says belcher
researchers say battery last long conventional batteries could power anything microelectronics including chemical biological sensors lab chip devices security tags larger items mobile phones computer displays even electric cars
building batteries like building anything requires assembly smaller battery challenging
current manufacturing techniques involve arranging nanoparticles nanotubes nanowires surfaces using expensive hightemperature methods
belcher team decided capitalise biologys inherent knack organising microscopic structures apply battery technology
viruses acting like wires
make viruses work like conducting wires scientists genetically altered organisms proteins surfaces would attracted metal particles including cobalt gold
four different solutions went battery component negatively charged polymer positively charged polymer negatively charged viruses charged particles ions cobalt
scientists spread negatively positively charged polymer solutions onto glass slide alternating layers next dipped slide solution containing millions altered viruses
wirelike viruses automatically spread evenly across slide natural tendency slightly repel
slide dipped ion solution proteins surface viruses attracted metal ions causing organisms become essentially conducting wires
viruses naturally replicate scientists say growing make many batteries shouldnt hard

scientists say terrestrial gammaray flashes could spark cloudtocloud lightning
ongoing hunt sources exotic gamma rays inside earths atmosphere taken two strange turns
one powerful radiation flashes triggered far closer ground ever suspected
least one case burst gamma rays appears happened burst cloudtocloud lightning like lightning trigger
terrestrial gammaray flashes thought occur electrons somehow sped near lightspeed slam air molecules
great burst energy collision releases enough create gamma rays one powerful form electromagnetic radiation
researchers thought way associated sprites enigmatic vertical bolts lighting zap upward high cloud tops towards space
new us research array groundbased spaceborne instruments located gammaray sources much deeper earths atmosphere thunderstorms
finding reported recently journal geophysical research letters puzzling thicker air lower atmosphere gobbles gamma rays pretty quickly
sprites logical choice link gammaray flashes says lead author dr mark stanley los alamos national laboratory
flashy energetic also close edge space would easily allow gamma rays escape atmosphere reach orbiting detectors
theres nothing thats quite shock says stanley
high flashes low ones
researchers took new measurements using groundbased los alamos sferic array detects electrical changes atmosphere gammaray detector onboard orbiting ramaty high energy solar spectroscopic imager
results indicate terrestrial gammaray flashes coming much lower come cloudtocloud lighting much thicker gammaray absorbing air
means exact source gamma rays putting lot gamma rays make space detected
detect distance means whatever causes incredibly violent says stanley
stanley colleagues found terrestrial gammaray flashes appear come less 15000 metres within range jet aircraft
im getting even lower stanley says
perhaps terrestrial gamma ray flashes created various elevations says lightning researcher assistant professor steven cummer duke university
higher detected orbiting imager lower detected ground
came first gamma rays lightning
stanley colleagues also refined timing events one case found gamma rays detected orbiting imager might preceded lightning complete surprise says
every way unusual says stanley
assumed terrestrial gammaray flashes product lightning initiation process also appears possible could also play role triggering lightning
really well understood says cummer
despite centuries research unlock secrets lighting including benjamin franklins discovery electrical nature cummer says nobody really knows starts lightning strike
male praying mantises one two types genitalia say researchers first time anyone seen type dimorphism insects
praying mantises genitalia hang left others right says behavioural ecologist
greg holwell australian postdoctoral researcher macquarie university says doesnt know
holwell reported unusual trait recent australasian association study animal behaviour conference sydney
holwell travelled queensland hoping study sexual cannibalism praying mantises mantids got bargained
rather finding examples females eating males found unique case dimorphism two distinct forms particular species
found males species ciulfina identical except genitalia mirror image another
genitalia point one direction unusual phenomenon says howell
knows species hes mated left righthanded males females theyve produced offspring survived dna studies also show species
really big thing says
rare find
dimorphism quite common example males females species extremely rare within particular sex says holwell
whats even rarer dimorphism genitalia says
many species distinctions particularly insects normally rely differences genitalia
holwell says two known cases dimorphism genitalia one involving female spiders involving male thrips
mantids first show mirrorimage genitalia
may genetic mutation thats occurred point left righthanded males dont particular advantage another forms survived population says
male mantids genitals consist number components enable male stimulate female attach transfer packets sperm called spermatophores
females perfectly symmetrical says holwell means asymmetrical males must twist abdomen mate females
direction twist depends way hang
strange behaviour
holwells colleagues also found males transfer sperm packet females inserted female left hanging
time mating female kind yoga twist pulls abdomen face pulls spermatophore eats says holwell
researchers want find whether female eats empty sperm packets means tidying
holwell says removes packets still containing sperm might way controlling male gets fertilise

present findings symposium memory performing arts international conference memory sydney july
brennan tested ability 72 people including musicians nonmusicians recognise musical themes popular tv shows friends law order mash
required differentiate original theme transposed version pitch tempo pitch tempo changed
differences musicians nonmusicians
brennan found musicians nonmusicians could identify original theme compared version pitch tempo changed
musicians much better identifying original theme compared version pitch tempo changed proportionally moved exactly degree
suggests nonmusicians remember music integrated piece information musicians compartmentalise elements music store discreet blocks brennan says
found nonmusicians store sound composite picture take entire piece information store relationally different aspects says
musicians store individual parameters example tempo key timbre
says storing relational information efficient storing separate elements compartmentalised approach accurate
reflects fact remembering musical sequences lower priority nonmusicians make music craft
musicians born made
brennan says research suggests learning musical instrument change mental pathways
suggests time musicians training leads particular paths store information says
dont think indicates prewiring brains certainly suggests period many years training allocate perceptual resources little differently people
research also sheds light mechanisms govern remember things brennan says
probably represents fact allocate time training dealing fine details information tend store separate categories
conversely suggests many things deal arent focal points elegantly efficient way joining one single relationship construct

us extreme dreaders whose brains register simple fear
anyone ever waited dread dentist may find comfort findings new brain study
people researchers say waiting indeed hardest part finding distraction might help
study published journal science used brainimaging technique functional mri investigate neural mechanisms underlying dread
researchers looked specifically agony waiting painful procedure among 32 volunteers agreed series electric shocks foot
dreaded shock much repeatedly opted highervoltage jolt could get quickly
individuals dubbed extreme dreaders showed greater activity brain region related pain attention
findings say researchers indicate dread arises simple fear brains attention unpleasant event
dread often worse event says lead study author dr gregory berns professor psychiatry behavioural sciences emory university school medicine atlanta
says brainimaging results good news indicate extreme dreaders something alleviate problem
find distraction meditation exercise activity take focus anticipated event
shocking results
study berns colleagues took brain images volunteers agreed endure electrical shocks feet
first jolt preceded cue told participants intense would instance 60 maximum pain tolerance long would wait
second go participants presented choices shock delivered voltage timing jolt variables
example could choose shock 90 maximum pain tolerance delivered next 3 seconds one 60 intensity 27 seconds
extreme dreaders
32 volunteers nine extreme dreaders consistently opted stronger shock avoid longer wait
may seem illogical many people berns says extreme dreaders avoiding anguished wait makes sense
extreme dreaders showed particularly high activity brains socalled pain matrix buildup electrical shocks
activity specifically high areas related attention associated fear anxiety

good budget medical research short term says one expert
australian government spent budget surplus building nations future rd capacity rather tax breaks say commentators science community
200607 federal budget delivered a597 billion science innovation 5596 million universities primarily capital developments
government describes spending science innovation record level points big boost given medical research many say governments spending priorities leaving australia behind terms future capacity
professor snow barlow university melbourne says amount spent science innovation may record absolute terms percentage gross national product decreasing
actually lower 20 years says barlow former member prime ministers science engineering innovation council

people deliberately light bushfires want sort change life dont mean cause harm say australian researchers
dr colleen bryant australian institute criminology present research deliberately lit fires australasian bushfire conference 2006 brisbane next month
many reasons people light fires says bryant people complex course motives complex
community often views arsonists pyromaniacs bryant colleague matthew willis say deliberately lit fires due pyromania
willis says majority cases people deliberately light bushfires intend cause harm
dont tend turn mind consequences lighting fire rather focused creating change life
want relieve boredom creating havoc excitement arsonists crave recognition attention researchers say
light fires anger protest others believe altruistic clearing see dangerous fuelloads
sometimes multiple motives
targeting fire prevention campaigns
understanding motives people deliberately light fires useful designing fire prevention campaigns treatment programs arsonists researchers say
example willis says people light fires excitement often stay around fire view handiwork
says suggests fire crews look around talk people watching
knowing people light fires treated hero report fire put also useful especially fire services screening new members says willis
unfortunately people light fires become members fire services says fire services use knowledge part recruitment exercises
bryant says knowing certain proportion people get thrill lighting fires extreme bushfire days also helps fire services look people days
different types bushfires
well deliberately lit fires small number humancaused fires lit without motive include fires due accidents people mental disabilities lack control actions fires lit children
naturallycaused bushfires ravaged canberra january 2003 usually larger devastating lit humans researchers say account less 5 bushfires
say vast majority 30000 40000 fires occur across australia year caused humans somewhere around 50 deliberately lit

thats conclusion di smith phd candidate flinders university south australia studying archaeology farm graveyards
study believed first type australia possibly world found graveyards part cultural heritage great archaeological value
looking answer questions farmers keep abandoned vehicles machinery property keep long smith says
smith sent questionnaires 800 farmers including woolgrowers crocodile farmers grain croppers pig avocado farmers across australia
nearly 150 farmers responded 60 said farm graveyards many inherited
didnt sites many said used one regretted getting rid scrap dealer
farmers sites special useful purpose recycling became clear rubbish dumps farmers disposed stuff never looked smith says
followed questionnaire conducting detailed artefact surveys inventories mapping sites recording histories 16 farm graveyard sites across south australia victoria looked sites alberta canada
sites australia canada share many similarities smith says
canadian farmers neat approach often lining equipment neat rows along fences accessible
countries farmers inventive comes recycling instance using old machinery spare parts
smith says research gives important insight deeper meaning sites hold farmers families
important meaning agricultural heritage tells farmers theyve might going far place encapsulates cultural heritage says

new copyright laws protect online artists
federal governments proposed changes australian copyright law fail address issues facing digital artists experts say
attorney general philip ruddock announced reforms week saying would make law fairer consumers tougher copyright pirates
damien obrien queensland university technology law school says revised laws profess essentially fail keep track developing technologies emerging markets
doesnt look like theyre radical says seem fairly conservative
says new laws let people tape favourite tv show download music onto mp3 players
says wont make life easier creators socalled internet video mashups combine content number different sources produce something new
obrien coauthored paper called mashups remixes copyright law published university website says mashups made unauthorised use copyright material remain illegal proposed laws
mashups example remix culture roots postmodern tendency cannibalise texts various sources driven technology makes easier ever
example website could combine music one source images another source search function somewhere else
mashups common music videos websites example pop star kylie minogue used legal mashups music videos website chicagocrime mixes police data google maps
meanwhile ispecies search links data genbank academic literature google scholar images yahoo image search

first time history creativity subject regulation
professor matthew rimmer expert copyright law australian national university agrees proposed laws dont much address issues latest technologies
says changes go way recognising use copyright works critique humour
carte blanche says
obrien says disappointing reforms didnt include openended fair use clause would one way mashup artists others using copyright material legally
creative commons mashup guilds
one way address restrictions placed mashup artists concept creative common says jessica coates creative commons project run queensland university technology
concept artists license work use certain ways including mashup
idea licences used owners make work widely available coates says
youre trying innovation digital realm hard youre using reproductions time idea creative common licence try get material common realm long isnt used commercial purposes
mashup guilds another solution says obrien
mashup artists form guilds protect copyright holders threaten sue says
idea form group try counterbalance threat litigation

given choice goats like taste truffles onions apples garlic faced oranges like ones greek island crete cant refuse
goats sheep prefer taste truffles according new study shows ruminants wide palate suprising favourite flavours
study published may issue journal small ruminant research found sheep goats similar tastes sheep discriminating palate
flavour appear important sheep goats says australian coauthor csiro sustainable ecosystems researcher professor iain gordon
didnt test case may goats generally catholic varied diet sheep natural world eat range things different flavours
order preference sheep enjoy truffle garlic onion apple caramel maple orange flavours according new research goats prefer truffle onion apple garlic
gordon colleagues recruited 10 male scottish blackface sheep ovis aries 10 male feral hybrid goats capra hircus taste testers
researchers treated nutritionallyenhanced food pellets range synthetic humangrade flavourings avoiding bitter flavours goats sheep tend dislike
animals fasted hour researchers presented basins containing flavoured feeds 30 minutes

taking taste test
sheep goats chowed pungent earthy flavoured feeds shunning strawberries
view regarding flavours highly attractive even though rare health affects associated consumption example antiparasitic action worms garlic onion says gordon
also explains researchers give real truffles onions foods associated flavours animals wanted study animals preferences flavours alone independent nutritional content
dr alan duncan nutritional ecologist macaulay institute aberdeen scotland says flavour rankings make sense
species tended prefer flavours might naturally encounter fungitype truffle flavour onion garlic flavours found wild representatives cultivated vegetables says
fruity flavours tended avoided unsurprising since fruits generally feature repertoire natural foods encountered ruminant herbivores
slightly surprised sheep showed stronger preferences goats sheep predominantly grazing animal whereas goats readily consume shrubs woody vegetation

sex
early ancestors interbred chimpanzees two species drew apart millions years ago new paper suggests
provocative idea sketched us genome experts discovered hominids chimps diverged far recently much longer timescale anyone thought
time authors theorise two primates rather kissing cousins sex swapping genes making final separation
analysis revealed big surprises major implications human evolution says professor eric lander director broad institute harvard university massachusetts institute technology coauthor paper todays issue journal nature
belief humans chimpanzees shared common ancestor went separate ways around 6574 million years ago
basis carbondated fossil called toumai whose supporters say oldest known human critics though dismiss toumai ape
estimate also backed molecular clock method calculating evolution basis speed genes mutate
previous molecularclock studies focused average genetic difference human chimp
new paper takes different approach
looking dna
exploiting mountain data come human chimpanzee genome projects researchers compared genetic codes two species today
estimated various age key sequences rather overall average
believe two species made split later 63 million years ago probably less 54 million years ago words around 1 2 million years earlier toumai estimate
moreover speciation chimp hominid process emerged separate species took extraordinary long time around four million years
youngest chromosome human genome x helps determine gender average x around 12 million years recent 22 nonsex chromosomes scientists found
lander describes xs tender age evolutionary smoking gun
sex chromososmes
previous studies suggest sex chromosomes among vulnerable chromosomes comes interbreeding comingling places genes swift selective pressure
thus something unusual must happened way speciation initial split human chimp followed interbreeding whose results show progressive younger genes final separation
lead author dr nick patterson also broad institute says toumais claimed status humans ancestor somewhat clouded
possible toumai fossil recent previously thought dating correct would precede humanchimp split says
fact humanlike features suggest humanchimp speciation may occurred long period episodes hybridisation interbreeding emerging species

evidence preadaptation mechanism evolution insecticide resistance says hartley
says preexisting resistance let resistance organophosphate insecticides take rapidly specific diazinon resistance gene developed later
used dna old flies show one form alteration already existed flies 70 years ago long ever exposed organophosphate chemicals hartley says
allowed flies rapidly develop resistance organophosphate chemicals general better version mutation took flies
says research mainly tells us mechanism evolution occurred particular blowfly species also gives clue rapid evolution resistance occur
might help researchers predict potential insecticide resistance future says

tropics move another two three degrees poleward sahara desert could shift perhaps several hundred kilometres towards poles researchers say
tropical regions world expanding since 1979 say us climatologists say unclear whether phenomenon caused global warming
dr thomas reichler meteorology professor university utah salt lake city colleagues report findings todays issue journal science
analysing satellite temperature data collected 1979 2005 researchers estimate tropics expanded two degrees latitude 225 kilometres period
big deal says reichler tropics may expanding getting larger
phenomenon could explain increase droughts decrease precipitation observed recent years subtropical regions southwestern united states europes mediterranean basin scientists say
possible expansion tropics may totally new aspect climate change reichler says dont know sure triggered
besides global warming another possible cause depletion stratospheric ozone layer due pollutants refrigerant gases
jet streams play key role
meteorologists generally consider tropics lies 30degn 30degs
reichler team found hemispheres midlatitudes lower atmosphere troposphere became warmer compared latitudes past 26 years stratosphere become cooler
researchers argue change would pushed tropospheric jet streams fastmoving wind currents propel weather patterns towards poles
jet streams mark edge tropics moving poleward means tropics getting wider says study coauthor dr john wallace atmospheric sciences professor university washington seattle
says movement jet streams longterm impact rainfall
tropics move another two three degrees poleward century says wallace dry areas sahara desert could nudge farther toward pole perhaps hundred miles

technology match evolution mean modern humans still evolving
new evidence hobbit made stone tools found alongside might evidence humans still evolving says australian researcher
use technology doesnt mean outwitted evolutionary selection pressures says dr mark moore expert ancient stone flaking technology university new england

scientists recently argued tools found alongside hobbit liang bua cave complex made anyone modern humans
moore along australian indonesian colleagues think otherwise
team analysed techniques used make 500 tools found mata menge site 50 kilometres hobbit found
researchers say although tools would made 700000 years hobbit around seemed complex ones found alongside
researchers say tools probably made ancestors homo floresiensis suggesting long history toolmaking island
supports idea hobbit even small brain capable making tools found alongside says moore
previously reported tools could made without degree forethought usually associated modern humans
techniques used make tools arent quite sophisticated lot archaeologists would believe says moore
certainly within capabilities smallbrained hominid
implications evolution
discovered hobbit believe evolved larger bodied larger brained ancestor shrank time isolated island
fact hominid could still make stone tools despite shrinking brain suggests toolmaking key survival island
supports argument technology helps humans survive changing environments
moore thinks also tells us technology doesnt protect us evolutionary selection pressures like predators environmental factors affect survival
environment bigger force give credit says
theres underlying assumption popular media particular amongst scientists since adapt environment technology somehow buffering us forces natural selection says moore
says use technology hobbits ancestors adapt environment stop shrinking response selection pressures
even thought technological adaptation environment didnt mean stopped evolving says moore clearly continued evolving technology able stop happening
says could relevant current debates whether modern humans evolving

thats message new international research showing chilled readytoeat freshcut fruit retains high levels vitamin c antioxidants
cutting packaging fruit almost effect main antioxidants scientists report journal agricultural food chemistry
fact levels antioxidants increased selected fruits
researchers including university california davis took pineapples watermelon rockmelon strawberries mangoes kiwifruits processed half freshcut left half whole

researchers say rock formations pilbara represent diverse fossil ecosystem everyone agrees
researchers say found compelling new evidence earliest known forms life earth ancient rock australia
australian canadian scientists say found new varieties stromatolites rock formations left 343 billion years ago pilbara region western australia
researchers right stromatolites represent fossilised remains early microbes could cause scientists revise estimates life began earth estimates recent 19 billion years ago
paper published today journal nature also fuels ongoing controversy whether formations made living things chemical processes
lead author phd student abigail allwood sydneys macquarie university says scientists found stromatolite reef formed microbial organisms
reef along 10 kilometre part pilbara known strelley pool chert stc contains new types stromatolites looking like upside icecream cones others like egg cartons
astonishing thing reefs age time earths history existence life uncertain says
seeing evidence lifes existence probably well established already biodiverse suggests could emerged much earlier earths history
detractors say theyre convinced
martin brasier professor palaeobiology university oxford long argued biogenesis theory stc stromatolites isnt convinced todays paper
much caution needed making claims earliest signs life says
rocks great age must assume hypothesis nonbiological origin
seven new types
stc stromatolites first discovered 20 years ago declared likely biological origin
subsequent papers argued various alternative theories including formed hydrothermal deposits produced mineral crust structures mimicking stromatolites
today allwood reports found seven different types stromatolite potentially reflecting least seven different types organism
stromatolites modern environment associated whole community organisms potentially talking much diversity seven types organisms says
brasier argues allwood team demonstrated exact opposite biogenesis
says structures made living things would produced uniform rather varied shapes
wide range stromatolites reported nature indicates actually selforganising structures largely physicochemical origin says like sand dunes crystal formations
similar structures produced laboratory without microbes says
window evolution life
allwood says research sheds new light life began
says first stromatolites appeared soon carbonate platform containing formations became submerged rising sea levels
like organisms literally waiting wings right conditions emerge pounced spread rapidly everywhere says
says results also contradict theories early life emerged flourished extreme conditions
weve found hydrothermal activity occurs immediately stratigraphically stc says
rise stromatolites occurs hydrothermal activity goes away fall stromatolites occurs hydrothermal activity comes back
certainly supports notion life getting firm foothold flourishing association something quite normal

patients take active role managing health may still need help decisionmaking process researchers say
faced tough medical decision imagine youre making friend rather new study suggests
may make choices easier report scientists june issue journal general internal medicine
think understandably easy get caught difficulty moment patient diagnosed problem theyre facing complex treatment decision hard see big picture says dr brian zikmundfisher university michigan
actually relatively easy people gain different type perspective thinking would recommending someone else
zikmundfisher team looked phenomenon known omission bias
person faced medical decision may choose passive nonintervention rather active approach due fear causing harm
researchers asked 2399 people imagine patient doctor treating patient medical director creating patient guidelines parent making decision child
people study asked make medical choices two different scenarios
one deadly flu circulating kill 10 people arent vaccinated although vaccine carries 5 risk causing death
second participants asked decide whether treat slowgrowing cancer chemotherapy
changing hats
study participants likely choose active approach making decision professional rather
73 imagining doctors would opt vaccine compared 63 posing medical directors 48 making decision
total 68 taking physician medical director role opted chemotherapy compared 60 patient role
thinking parents 57 study participants would choose vaccine child 72 would opt chemotherapy
suggests zikmundfisher says child already sick parent may feel comfortable choosing active treatment making decision choose preventive potentially risky treatment healthy child
advice doctors
doctors increasingly allowing patients part decisionmaking process zikmundfisher notes findings suggest shouldnt opt advising patients entirely
physician might able act coach help guide decision making process says
doctors could propose patients try think making decision friend explains
helping patient take step back might make better decisionmaking process around
feeling itchy
genes gender help determine individuals urge scratch itch suggests new study
study pruritus otherwise known itch first demonstrate sex differences itchinduced scratching behaviour animals
researchers studied mice say findings could apply humans mammals
conclusion females scratched 23 often males
havent investigated underlying mechanisms sex difference yet usually involve gonadal reproductive gland hormones oestrogen progesterone testosterone either development adulthood says professor jeffrey mogil one researchers
mogil specialist genetics pain mcgill university canada colleagues induced itching mice administering chloroquine malaria drug causes itchiness
researchers also used histamines compounds produced mammalian tissues dilate small blood vessels histamines largely responsible itchiness associated allergies hence relief provided antihistamines
teams findings published online journal pain
mogil says itch one common reasons people seek medical care
explains pruritus important symptom many skin systemic autoimmune diseases
numerous medications malaria drug administered mice cause itching troubling side effect itching also chronic condition right
pain
common reason people seek medical attention course pain
interestingly enough mogil team found individuals sensitive pain resistant itch less pain sensitivity greater tendency scratch
think pain itch wired brain opposites sense inheriting particular forms painitchrelevant genes would simultaneously make sensitive pain less sensitive itch vice versa speculates
researchers pointed scratching point pain wellknown strategy alleviating itch conversely pain medications local anesthesia often intensify histamineinduced itching
women feel pain
painitch correlation however complicated findings another study last year journal plastic reconstructive surgery found women feel pain intensely men
dr bradon wilhelmi plastic surgeon authored paper discovered women average 34 nerve fibres per square centimetre facial skin men possess around 17 nerve fibres area
women nerve receptors may experience pain powerfully men requiring different surgical techniques treatments medicine dosages help manage pain make feel comfortable wilhelmi says
could women sensitive men pain itch women evolved level pain tolerance perhaps due giving birth
mogil hopes future research show genes turn urge itch proteins made genes work genes may linked pain sensitivity

passenger air travel growing rate around 5 year could account 15 manmade co2 emissions 2050
restrictions night flights could ease aviation industrys fastgrowing contribution global warming say uk scientists
dr nicola stuber fellow meteorologists university reading report findings todays issue journal nature
certain altitudes aircraft produce contrails condensation trails caused planes hot exhaust hits chilly atmosphere
contrails surprisingly big also complex effect climate
clouds trap heat emitted earths surface creating greenhouse effect adds warming
yet daytime clouds cooling effect white thus reflect suns energy back space certain conditions contrails exist several hours
stuber team estimate radiation caused contrails busy flight corridor southeast england
using highresolution aircraft flight data routine weather balloon data looked persistent contrails wakes remained hour aircraft flown
night flights account 22 britains annual air traffic contribute 60 80 greenhouse effect contrails scientists found
winter flights warm
stuber team also found flights winter months could contribute global warming
also found flights december february contribute half annual mean climate warming even though account less quarter annual air traffic says stuber
although fewer flights winter months conditions needed form contrails right temperature amount moisture air aircraft altitude found often
growing problem
global emissions manmade co2 62 billion 69 billion tonnes per year added around 15 billion tonnes land use
commercial aircraft account small contribution compared power stations industry road traffic
however passenger travel growing rate around 5 year means share grow fast
1999 estimate uns intergovernmental panel climate change ipcc found airline industry accounted 2 manmade co2 emissions 1992 would rise much 15 2050
environmentalists angry complaining airlines get free ride comes environmental taxes
changing altitude could also help
addition rescheduling night flights daytime planes could diminish contribution global warming changing altitude
study published last year journal transportation research suggests regions icesupersaturated air contrails form 500 metres thick
goal would fit sensors aircraft could inform pilots layer lies thus enabling shift altitude accordingly

better understanding brain altered syndrome develop better drugs future
migraines commonly associated symptoms sleep abnormalities higher risk depression altered sex drive may another quirk migraine adds
sex alleviate migraine pain
houle team note commonly believed sex drive reduced headaches sexual intercourse cause specific types headaches
say research suggested sexual intercourse may alleviate pain migraine patients
researchers tested theory migraine sexual desire may associated serotonin
reduced libido often accompanies depression treatment selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ssri increases brain levels serotonin whereas migraine associated reduced serotonin levels
investigate complex relationship houle team recruited 59 adults least 10 headaches annually
twentythree subjects 7 men 16 women classified migraine 36 18 men 18 women tensiontype headache
subjects completed selfadministered sexual desire inventory sdi allowed rate much think sex much desire sex
men reported 24 higher sex drive women says houle difference migraine tensiontype headache almost equivalent 20
thus women migraines reported relative levels sex drive men tension type headaches
ninepoint scale subjects specifically rated sexual desire compared others age sex
migraine patients reported highest level 50 expected median 40 item houle team say
tensiontype headaches gave average rating 37 item
sexual desire still normal
houle says migraine patients aware rated sexual desire higher patients group
adds evidence sexual desire beyond high normal hypersexual
hypothesised serotonergic link may implicated migraine headaches sexual desire researchers conclude
serotonin receptors also appear involved several aspects sexual functioning

construction vault began week
built top security a4 million us3 million depository preserve around three million seeds representing known varieties worlds crops subzero temperatures
fowler executive secretary global crop diversity trust international nonprofit organisation supports worlds critical crop collections currently scattered among 1400 gene banks
according main threat worlds crops probably nuclear war
rather annual budget cuts plant institutes gene banks around world well occasional power failure thaws seeds fail germinate
course also risk wars catastrophes wiping whole institute cases big headlines variety irrevocably lost says
convincing world problem hasnt easy fowler says
people get perception magnitude loss tell end 1800s 7000 named apple varieties grown united states says
6800 extinct dinosaurs
genetics disaster
fowler earned phd social sciences swedens uppsala university says life changed early 1970s read paper botanist jack harlan entitled genetics disaster
harlan plant explorer geneticist breeder understood crops origins use sustaining mankind
seed collections 35 countries stored gene banks throughout world samples returned home countries lost local gene banks
work inspired fowler
store svalbard one two million seed samples germ plasm work countless generations farmers thousands years fowler says
crops oldest artefacts world older pyramids alive
nation ever maintained prosperous food system based genetic resources purely indigenous origin
today maize native central america predominant food crop southern africa soybean species china east asia major crop us brazil fowler says
lessons potato famine
bestknown case crop almost wiped 19th century irish potato famine led million deaths
country relied one variety one crop staple food variety resistance disease
wasnt enough genetic diversity provide protection fowler says
without able go back many wild species hundreds farmers varieties latin america none us would eating potatoes today
road svalbard vault long bumpy one fowler played major role stage inventories plant resources resolving ownership issues
major problem world right say straight face actually solve says
one major problem fix put back burner move something else
trust work closely united nations food agriculture organisation help support gene banks around world remain first line defence

future looks bit brighter giant panda
many giant pandas previously thought say scientists studying dna panda faeces
professor michael bruford cardiff university school biosciences professor fuwen wei institute zoology chinese academy sciences led study reported current issue journal current biology
giant panda one worlds elusive endangered species
traditional way estimate panda populations examine faeces length bamboo contains bruford says
researchers would guess pandas age estimate many different pandas faeces come
bruford says say new method provides accurate estimates panda populations
without dna profiling bound underestimate says
brufords team surveyed 26 square kilometres chinese reserve
really combed reserve teams people field walking line says
previously thought 27 giant pandas lived bufords team thinks 66
researchers urge complacency
predicts results would replicated panda reserves
results found previous surveys underestimated population 50 says bruford
findings indicate species much better chance longterm viability although must become complacent since population size still perilously low
bruford warns still may talking thousand individuals guys common

beads made type shells
human culture developed slowly northern africa middle east rather bursting forth europe suggest scientists discovered may oldest shell beads dating back 100000 years
dr francesco derrico national centre scientific research talence france colleagues report findings todays issue journal science
recently researchers generally believed first cultural signs emerged 40000 years ago modern humans appeared europe
derrico colleagues say new shell beads israel algeria made decorative purposes show progress came much earlier northern africa middle east
modern humans africa developed behaviours considered modern quite early time says derrico
people probably biologically modern also culturally cognitively modern
jewellery forms personal decoration one important early expressions human culture says study coauthor dr marian vanhaeren university college london

lava flows super eruption half billion years ago australia covered hundreds thousands square kilometres
scattered rafts black lava northern central australia really part one gigantic volcanic field appears one oldest largest earth geologists believe
half billion year old eruption might culprit first mass animal extinction event history life
australian geologists used chemical signatures farflung basalt lava rocks ages connect single huge volcanic eruptive episode 505 508 million years ago
newly identified kalkarindji continental flood basalt province covered least 650000 square kilometres 190000 cubic kilometres lava report geologists dr linda glass dr david phillips australian national university research undertaken
bigger thought
may lot larger think phillips says
says since paper appeared month journal geology hes getting calls australian geologists say know even distant pieces could mega lava deposit
unlike episodic hacking explosive volcanoes like mount st helens mount pinatubo flood basalts literally pour lava onto earths surface often vastly greater quantities far longer periods perhaps many hundreds thousands years according geologists
means cover lot ground
younger recent flood basalts found mostly intact places like columbia river region us pacific northwest
halfbillion years old kalkarindji continental flood basalts heavily eroded buried leaving farflung hints former glory
part growing picture says paul renne director berkeley geochronology center california
large volcanic provinces identified way
first one area geologists flurry discoveries geologists working parts puzzle hadnt seen larger context
link cambrian mass extinction
two things make kalkarindji continental flood basalt province discovery special robust says renne
one oldest lava formation dated using reliable argon40argon39 analysis phillips one worlds top argonargon researchers renne says
renne adds chemical aging farflung rocks makes process dating slightly less reliable
second thing timing kalkarindji right first major dieoff animals first exploded onto scene 535 million years ago lower cambrian period

theres evidence similar patterns apply girls says
fraternal birth order effect
results variation socalled fraternal birth order effect theory homosexuality men
researchers didnt investigate mechanism play bogaert says study indicates biological rather social childrearing factors play
one possible explanation pregnancy mothers immune system recognises male foetuses foreign creates maternal antimale antibodies
antibodies could affect part brain determines sexuality
effect cumulative therefore likely cause homosexuality last several sons born mother
results support prenatal origin sexual orientation development men indicate fraternal birth order effect probably result maternal memory male gestations births says
female foetuses arent affected mothers female mother doesnt create antibodies daughters
bogaert reports age mother also appears related sexual orientation sons homosexual mens mothers significantly younger mothers heterosexual men

clues water seepage
scientists made discovery studying 20 years data water seeping wells seven earthquakes area california
found water levels wells rose fell gradually according local weather rainfall
superimposed longterm trends regular daily variations centimetres owing solid earth tides
motion moon around earth makes local sea levels rise fall tidally day earths rotation causes tidal squeezing solid earth
effect tiny squeezes porous rock aquifer feeds wells pressurising water held pores forcing regular changes 3 centimetres well water
squeezing subsides well water flows back aquifer
quickly happens depends permeability rock
team noticed every time earthquake occurred permeability jumped surrounding rocks became three times permeable
months tremor rocks relaxed back original state permeability returned normal levels
scientists planning studies better understand aspects shaking makes permeability increase
also interested studying seismically induced changes fluid flow within geological faults might trigger earthquakes

study showed children stuttered showed greater emotional reactivity everyday stresses like toy taken away
preschoolers stutter may difficulty controlling emotions children age study found suggesting emotional factors contribute speech disorder
dr edward conture us professor hearing speech sciences vanderbilt university nashville colleagues report findings journal communication disorders
stuttering common speech problem typically becomes apparent ages 2 5 years old children may repeat draw words parts words difficulty beginning word
exact cause stuttering unknown probably involves complex interaction genes environment says conture
stuttering believed strong genetic component often runs families
also long suspected emotional development may contribute disorder says conture
team found preschoolers stuttered typically excitable peers normal speech tended harder time calming shifting attention away stressful situation
findings based reports parents 65 preschoolers stuttered 56 children groups parents completed standardised questionnaire child behaviour
three general differences two groups emerged conture says
children stuttered showed greater emotional reactivity everyday stresses like toy taken away took longer settle excited upset less adept shifting attention away stressor often becoming fixated instead
researchers suspect poor attentional control leading higher levels emotional reactivity may contribute development stuttering children predisposed speech problem
findings support parents observations
conture says findings line parents often tell childs doctor speech therapist emotional outbursts excitement seem trigger stuttering episodes
says parents tell health care provider notice child regularly strong emotional reactions everyday challenges changes daily routine
parents may able help child demonstrating ways calmly cope stressful situations says conture
also notes children difficulty controlling negative emotions excitement positive events well may good idea said tell child trip somewhere exciting months beforehand
one knows yet whether helping children better regulate emotions aid stuttering problems conture says current findings tell us something look
also emphasises parents feel guilty role emotional control might play stuttering evidence parents cause children stutter conture says
30 people surveyed felt comfortable gm plants food 18 felt comfortable gm animals food
australians becoming comfortable new technologies like stem cell research still strong reservations genetically modified foods new survey shows
survey conducted australian centre emerging technologies society swinburne university melbourne asked 1000 people views emerging technologies
overall australians optimistic science technology says professor michael gilding director centre conducted survey swinburne national technology science monitor

scientists learning baboons communicate means evolution human language
study baboons gesture hands suggests gesturing may precursor human language scientists say
findings could help explain humans often gesture hands particularly right hand speak
right hand controlled brains left hemisphere source linguistic functions
scientists believe communication hand probably existed apes 30 million years ago forerunner spoken written language
french researchers adrien meguerditchian professor jacques vauclair studied particular hand gesture 60 captive baboons
gesture consists quick repetitive rubbing slapping hand ground used threaten intimidate others
researchers university provence say motion might comparable humans slap one hand toward palm hand
study published journal behavioural brain research researchers observed gesture occurred naturally
also triggered human abruptly shake head glance baboon head shaking another threatening move ape monkey world includes sorts communicative gestures
nonhuman primate effectively raise arm ask social partner groom give another little slap invitation play touch furtively hand genitals another greet slap ground threaten researchers say
right hand left hand
among baboons test group favoured certain hand 78 righthanded tended gesture hand studies shown human babies deaf individuals also communicate right hands
little chance primate cousins evolve language skills near future researchers say
monkeys apes specific communication systems result evolutionary roads humans unlikely natural selection primate species reproduce exactly phylogenetic path gave linguistic skills humans

current knowledge ocean temperatures mainly come merchant ships northern hemisphere says rintoul
southern ocean lot less shipping traffic relatively measurements ocean temperatures
says rintoul beauty penguin seal oceanographers swim places hard scientists get
also deliver many measurements
example research vessel might deliver 150 temperature profiles sixweek trip antarctica whereas 15strong penguin team delivers 36000 profiles threeweek journey
seals dive deeper less frequently deliver 16000 profiles six month season
one advantage seals bigger penguins means carry equipment
specifically seals carry sensors measure salinity important understanding density ocean calculating specific speed currents
ocean currents key
rintoul physical oceanographer climate scientist says project looking currents distribute heat ocean key factor understanding climate

larsen ice shelf seen collapsing 2002 may greater threat faster westerly winds antarctica
heatbearing westerly winds picked speed past 50 years likely contributing melting antarcticas larsen ice shelf say scientists
meteorologist professor john turner british antarctic survey says biggest change wind speed occurs southern hemisphere summer
ice ice shelf melted summer season winds increased says turner gave keynote talk scientific committee antarctic research meeting hobart week
antarctica generally lower temperatures pressures areas northern latitudes like australia
differential generates storms take warm air south cold air north
turner says past 50 years differential appears increased increased speed westerly winds southern ocean average knots
increase speed means westerlies blowing antarctic peninsula rather around bringing destructive warm air onto larsen ice shelf east peninsula says turner
says pickup westerlies also influence climate elsewhere planet driving antarctic circumpolar current faster current shifts vast amounts water plays major role global heat transfer
beyond natural variability
pressure temperature differential antarctica northern latitudes goes natural cycles turner says climate models suggest recent changes exceptional compared past 1000 years
weve seen last 50 years larger anything models says suggests man playing part
turner says increase speed westerlies ties prediction extreme storms warming world
says models also support idea increasing greenhouse gases causing westerlies increase although exactly known
research increasing speed westerlies role melting larsen ice shelf due published soon journal climate

melting ice shelves dont affect sea level already floating role holding back ice flowing main part peninsula jeopardy

long water good enough drink researchers say good enough clean uninfected wounds
medical workers disaster areas longer wait sterile equipment clean dress wounds thanks australian research
professor rhonda griffiths university western sydneys centre applied nursing says long water good enough drink evidence suggests good enough clean uninfected wounds
weve demonstrated traditional ways dressings unnecessarily expensive labour intensive says griffiths
adds doubt tap water suitable drinking boiled use
griffiths colleagues recently completed systematic review evidence cochrane collaboration comparing use saline versus tap water clean uninfected wounds
review found washing wounds including leg ulcers water show increase infection decrease healing time compared using saline says
result cochrane collaboration recommending tap water used clean wounds developing countries disaster zones says griffiths
community
community nurses treat people home first triggered investigation use tap water clean wounds says griffiths
hospitals routinely use saline sterilised water clean uninfected wounds community nurses traditionally relied people simply shower dress wounds
hospitals one practice says griffiths community another

griffith says research changing way think managing types wounds
cleanliness rather sterility thats important says
better patients cheaper
griffiths says washing wounds tap water would save money hospitals especially cost disposable sterile equipment required using saline
patients also prefer washing water says get bed take shower
tap water may safe effective griffiths still wants confirm findings find saline offers advantages carrying much larger randomised controlled trial

less 15 generations half population england anglosaxon genes
anglosaxons conquered england 5th century set system apartheid enabled master outbreed native british majority according gene research
less 15 generations half population england genes invaders investigators say
native britons genetically culturally absorbed anglosaxons period little hundred years says dr mark thomas university college london biologist
initially small invading anglosaxon elite could quickly established children survived adulthood thanks military power economic advantage
believe also prevented native british genes getting anglosaxon population restricting intermarriage system apartheid left country culturally genetically germanised says
see today population largely germanic genetic origin speaking principally german language
thomas believes study published journal proceedings royal society b answers key questions one turning points european history
happened romans
anglosaxons germanic tribes lived presentday germany northern holland denmark invaded britain 450 ad fall roman empire
conquered england unable penetrate far celtic fringes wales scotland coincidentally prompted exodus britons brittany france
population england time probably around two million number anglosaxons minute lowest estimate puts number migrants less 10000 200 years invasion although others put 100000
could tiny minority ruled country emphatically could skirt assimilation native british majority impose language laws economy culture whose stamp visible today
answer suggest thomas colleagues apartheidlike social structure enshrined anglosaxons master native britons called welshmen germanic word slave servants
historical evidence
evidence comes ancient texts including laws ine late 7th century ruler wessex anglosaxon kingdom western england
ine set payments wergild blood money payable family killing one members order prevent blood feud
anglosaxon killed wergild two five times fine payable life welshman comparable status
burial sites also provide pointer economic social disparity
skeletal remains men believed anglosaxons often found alongside weapon precious artefacts whereas native britons usually weaponless one two objects
previous work thomas team compared gene pool among native white englishmen central england today counterparts ancestral lands anglosaxons
found two groups shared 50 100 telltale variations male sex chromosome
genes map growth decline
latest research used computer simulations try explain segregation would enabled anglosaxons flourish native britons decline
computer model uses various scenarios involving size immigration influx different ethnic intermarriage rates reproductive advantage anglosaxon wealth resources
apartheid best known today notorious racial segregation prevailed whiteminority south africa
authors point many examples history conquerors settlers used controls avoid assimilation nurture identity maintain political military economic supremacy ethnic majority
time king alfred great 9th century differences legal status anglosaxons britons faded altogether
two centuries later normans invaded england imposed apartheid giving higher legal status britons allowing norman men marry native women preventing native men marrying norman women
sunlight scarce commodity antarctica thats affecting vitamin levels researchers
scientific researchers spending winter antarctica might increased risk osteoporosis unless take vitamin supplements new research suggests

antarctic octopuses seen gave rise deep sea relatives
colder antarctic waters drove evolution deep sea octopuses suggests new research
australian researcher dr jan strugnell queens university belfast british antarctic survey says formation ocean currents around continent millions years ago provided right conditions ocean creatures evolve
presented research octopus evolution last week scientific committee antarctic research meeting hobart
previous research suggests range deep sea creatures origins antarctica says strugnell
people thought lots different taxa maybe happened noones really investigated properly
strugnell decided test theory studying evolution antarctic deep sea octopuses
constructed family tree comparing octopus dna morphological features including number suckers
using fossils calibrate evolutionary dates strugnell says antarctic octopuses relatives evolved around 48 million years ago
findings far suggest deep sea octopuses evolved antarctic octopuses time 34 million years ago
strugnell supported findings using evidence completely different source
continental confirmation
various stages earths history example 100 60 million years ago global climate change depleted oxygen deep sea animals went extinct
strugnell says evolution octopuses deep sea would possible waters became oxygenated antarctic octopuses able colonise

thank verbal nature along fingers ability develop complex number systems new study suggests
authors theorise language maths coevolved humans language probably emerging ahead basic mathematical concepts
think counting words among first words spoken species application makes use fairly sophisticated pattern linking occurred relatively late linguistic evolution says author dr heike wiese whose study accepted publication journal lingua
wiese linguist university potsdam germany says use counting words numbers general probably emerged four stages
first stage wiese believes humans began using visual representations symbols markings correspond verbal indications quantity
among early evidence stage 30000yearold wolf bone excavated czech republic notched tallies cut
second stage development according new study evolution finger counting
hands like builtin abacus physiology allows us bend fingers individually also allowed emergence ability count sequence
third stage wiese thinks emphasis began placed last word finger counting series
emphasis seems inherent human thinking example child learning count asked many teddy bears child gives whole sequence numbers puts emphasis last word one two three four teddy bears
since humans 10 fingers number became natural transition point stage allowing people count upward sets 10
finally wiese believes fullblown number concept emerged humans use stable wordlists linked amounts counting words numbers says merely refer numbers numbers
idea numbers abstract platonic entities must grasped us mental tools develop tools use assess properties like cardinality four buses rank fourth bus identity number four bus says
counting words mathematical concepts therefore intertwined language skills even appear dependent upon though reverse case
cultures huntergatherer piraha amazon language even possess systems numbers counting
professor terrence deacon linguist university california berkeley agrees many conclusions wieses study
wiese builds case numerical cognition growing symbolic cognition base language parasitic spinoff mere naming numerical concepts ability whose roots extend underlying cognitive operations says

lose weight high carbohydrate diet carbs equal
theres difference low gi diet high protein diet comes losing weight australian study shown
study published archives internal medicine today first directly compare high protein diets based foods low glycaemic index gi
research shows low gi diets better high protein diets reducing bad ldl low density lipoprotein cholesterol associated cardiovascular disease
terms weight fat loss low gi diet high protein diet exactly difference terms weight fat loss two studies reports lead author joanna mcmillanprice university sydneys human nutrition unit
professor jennie brandmiller coauthored low gi diet revolution mcmillan also involved research
turning carbohydrates glucose
low gi diets originally used control diabetes ability prevent dramatic fluctuations insulin levels
body takes longer convert low gi foods glucose means glucose released bloodstream slowly preventing spikes insulin levels leave feeling hungry prevent breakdown fat
recently low gi diets gained popularity among dieters celebrities like kylie minogue reported favour low gi foods
highly processed low fibre foods like white bread soft drinks high gi foods like dark whole grain breads fruit legumes low gi
fat cholesterol
researchers put 129 overweight men women one four diets 12 weeks
four one low gi another high protein
end study low gi high protein group lost amount weight
third diet heavy carbohydrates high gi achieved slowest rate weight loss
ldl cholesterol declined significantly low gi group increased among people high protein diet
mcmillanprice says research suggests low gi diet best eating choice also vindicates consumption right kind carbohydrates wanting lose weight
long weve hype high protein must reduce carbs mcmillanprice says
confusing message quite reassuring hear yes eat high carb diet long im smart carbs choose
high protein low gi
dr peter clifton research director csiro human nutrition says study shows high protein low gi diets reduce weight
certainly study doesnt provide evidence low gi diets best theyre equivalent says clifton coauthored bestselling csiro highprotein total wellbeing diet

professor bursill retired former chief executive officer cooperative research centre water quality treatment says always risks sewage turned drinking water
says chance pathogens chemicals slipping even sophisticated filtering systems cant ruled
bursill also says water workers would need specially trained regulatory system beefed cope new recycling technology
im glad community toowoomba rejected dont think ready says
australia also needs concentrate using existing water resources efficiently turning solutions like recycling says
toowoombas vote came ahead pending release draft guidelines use recycled sewage developed environment protection heritage council national resource management ministerial councils
first half guidelines dealing recycled sewage nondrinking purposes expected september
second half deal range issues including recycled drinking water scheduled released public consultation middle next year

latest study provides evidence men like women biological clock
risk miscarriage appears rise along fathers age regardless old mother researchers report
study looked nearly 14000 women pregnant 1960s 70s
researchers found risk miscarriage 60 greater father age 40 older 2529 years old
whats age made difference even men 30s miscarriage risk three times greater man 3539 years age younger 25
risks independent mothers age wellknown factor miscarriage researchers report latest issue journal obstetrics gynecology
findings add evidence showing like women men biological clock
although men continually produce new sperm father children late life research shows fertility gradually declines starting relatively young age
also women older fathers likely children birth defects
one recent study found mans ability child fades age 40 similar womans fertility decline age 35
another confirmed genetic abnormalities sperm steadily become common men age

could epsteinbarr virus transmitted via sex well kissing
sex may increase odds contracting glandular fever virus uk study suggests
means doctors patients may rethink currently call kissing disease
findings would also implications vaccines tested epsteinbarr virus ebv causes disease
study common condition young people also known mononucleosis published journal clinical infectious diseases
510 college students initially free ebv nearly half became infected virus next three years sexually active students greater risk
students said theyd intercourse study likely become infected reported romantic relationships well whose relationships limited kissing petting
findings suggest sexual intercourse makes ebv transmission likely according study authors led dr dorothy crawford university edinburgh
adults worldwide infected ebv first infecting person remains dormant body life
time initial infection causes apparent symptoms especially contracted childhood
developed countries infection often doesnt occur adolescence young adulthood likely make people sick
glandular fever marked often prolonged fever fatigue sore throat swollen lymph nodes
according crawfords team new findings suggest sexually active teens adults may exposed larger dose ebv particularly deep kissing possibly genital fluids carry virus
large viral load increases odds developing glandular fever researchers note ebv vaccine may successful even merely decreases amount ebv body rather providing complete immunity
suggest vaccine reduces level viral infection andor replication primary infection could sufficient prevent glandular fever researchers conclude
hawaiian islands rich cultural history evidenced prehistoric etchings lava rocks archaeologists discovered rise fall civilisations island maui
ancient temple system hawaiian island maui 400 years older previously thought according extensive archaeological study
finding contradicts prior theory mauis temples built within span decades around year 1600
researchers think temples built course 500 years construction cycles peaking periods significant political change
see construction phases parallel shifts political control says associate professor michael kolb led study accepted publication journal current anthropology
chiefs likely wanted mark territory whenever new leader came power would probably seek validate new political ideological ideas modification expansion temple system adds kolb professor anthropology northern illinois university
radiocarbon dating charcoal beneath building foundations formed basis new research charcoal remains left behind ancient builders cleared vegetation controlled fires
usually archaeologists rely dating ceramics ceramics exist early hawaiian history
lot soil formation islands polynesians settled maui lacked clay therefore pottery kolb says

one islands bestknown temples piilanihale heiau means house piilani popular chief
mauis largest temple covering area football field standing 12 metres height piilanihale dated 1294
scientists believe initial 13th century building phase followed subsequent periods construction 14th century particularly active phase near turn 17th century
kolb explains although polynesians inhabited hawaiian islands early year 300 settlements initially small spreading time
ancient polynesians interested ancestor worship built small places worship paving land stacking rocks according archaeological evidence early shrines hawaii tahiti
time polynesian culture shifted toward sacrificial worship led enormous platform temples built cliff faces prominent spots
elaborate temples featured altars oracle towers offering pits palisades drum houses god ancestral images carved wood stone

still clear research relates brain development humans
ultrasound disrupts brain development unborn mice us researchers say study adds growing evidence many scans could also affect human foetuses
prolonged ultrasound scans brains foetal mice interfered process known neuronal migration neurones move one place another team yale university reports
proper migration neurones development essential normal development cerebral cortex function says dr pasko rakic chair department neurobiology yale
observed small significant number neurones mouse embryonic brain migrate proper positions cerebral cortex following prolonged frequent exposure ultrasound
writing proceedings national academy sciences rakics team says findings necessarily mean ultrasound human foetuses dangerous
researchers say doctors pregnant women probably keep scans minimum
pros cons
ultrasound scans give parents peek unborn child doctors chance see serious defects might corrected right birth
several studies suggest ultrasound may affect developing brain necessarily adversely
instance 1993 study published lancet journal found foetuses exposed ultrasound womb likely lefthanded
separate study found possible decrease weight newborns scanned third found delayed speech
another study showed children received ultrasound exams birth actually better language tests older says dr verne caviness massachusetts general hospital
study clearly needed rakic says
evidence ultrasound waves cause behavioural effects mice effect developing human brain says
therefore want emphasise study mice mean use ultrasound human foetuses appropriate diagnostic medical purposes abandoned
contrary ultrasound shown beneficial medical context rakic adds
says study suggests pregnant women get multiple ultrasound scans fun curiosity
mouse study

next year scientists hope collect 3500 pieces information per person first 6000080000 people
palmer told 11th international congress human genetics congress brisbane first step proposed western australia genome health project one number socalled biobanks established around world
palmer estimates project would cost several hundred million dollars team seeking support federal government along way
obvious thing study whole population says
well things like full body scans everyone full respiratory cardiovascular workups well taking pictures everyones retina hearing assessments well scanning thousands brains
three days data collection person happen schools home central facilities
everyone including children asked participate palmer says
data also collected indigenous australians although done separate umbrella indigenous input
perfect population
palmer says western australia well suited kind study isolated yet outbred population relatively low migration rate historically large families
also extensive existing records much necessary infrastructure including western australian dna bank says biggest linked health database world
palmer says rising incidence chronic disease together increasingly unsustainable health system growth new tools technology made project possible necessary

pressure predictive genetic testing coming surprising source new study shows
people coming pressure family members doctors even insurance agencies genetic tests australian study reveals
findings contained final report community component longawaited genetic discrimination project presented 11th international congress human genetics brisbane today
chief investigator associate professor sandra taylor central queensland university told conference 32 respondents reported feeling family forced undergo predictive genetic testing type gauges persons chance developing disease
asked people experienced coercion felt coercion terms undertaking testing respondents answered says
reported however category frequently reported within context family follow doctors genetic clinicians researchers insurers
says family pressure doesnt necessarily refer coercive events rather peoples perceptions whats expected
family context people may feel coerced want help establish risks people family without necessarily family members applying pressure
discrimination
study surveyed 951 adults tests inherited conditions including neurological conditions cancer blood disorder haemochromatosis 1998 2003
total 11 107 951 respondents reported one incidents discrimination
experienced discrimination said experienced negative treatment life insurers bosses felt family personal relationships adversely affected others felt discriminated healthcare providers
report also found people either didnt know go complain negative treatment didnt want citing red tape concern consequences
would think theres need increased education consumers rights regarding seeking review making complaints negative treatment taylor says
however people also said considerable benefits test
genetic tests workplace
meanwhile separate section report looking discrimination employers life insurance agencies found 92 cases investigated 1999 2003 insurance companies acted reasonably
three cases apparently unreasonable insurance underwriting relating people tested positive breast cancer genes brca1 brca2
first national study kind thirdparty survey also found negligible evidence genetic tests used 381 employers surveyed
none asked genetic test done one employer asked previous test
however strong potential use genetic test information increase future investigator professor margaret otlowski university tasmania told conference

boolarra carp
carp cyprinus carpio first introduced southeastern australia late 1800s didnt become problem fish farmer released particularly robust strain town boolarra victoria early 1960s
haynes research suggests boolarra strain bred existing koi japanese carp earlier releases began colonisation southeastern waterways
study could also resolve question whether boolarra strain illegally imported obtained locally population prospect reservoir new south wales
official story came prospect people say imported europe haynes says
look like strain supposedly responsible carp widespread european didnt need lot input asian carp well
implies carp probably well adapted got australia didnt need breed australians well
almost everywhere
carp currently established every australian state territory except northern territory
pose serious problem australian waterways make 90 fish biomass rivers putting pressure native fish
haynes says carp likely remain pest certainly establish new regions
understanding genetics make easier control says
significant genetic differentiation within regions australia implications carp management says
regions probably managed separately get best result
forget mars month say astromomers look jupiter instead
repeat last years spoof email promising mars look large moon later month causing headaches astronomers science educators
say mars hoax appears resilient moon hoax denies moon landings ever happened

email originally dates 2003 opposition mars red planet bright spectacular closer earth 60000 years says
certainly didnt couldnt look big moon need read email carefully notice mars would look big moon telescope magnified 75 times
says mars vary brightness distance earth changes
without telescope never look much bigger ordinary star
contrary email month mars low sky visible west sunset
teachers also fooled hoax
weve several calls children whose homework find planet going bigger ever says mccormick
hardest thing disappoint children clearly excited think going see sort thing turns science astronomy something usually turns
however takes opportunity tell although mars may disappointing month giant planet jupiter well placed observing
actually much spectacular mars bright easy find good binoculars see planet four moons says
mccormick also tells check bad astronomy website uses science debunk hoaxes like
everyone concerned mccormick mars email like alan macrobert senior editor sky telescope magazine

realise violence issue us common factors well violence really related race
lea genetic epidemiologist institute environmental science research wellington says maori men overrepresentation monoamine oxidase dubbed warrior gene associated aggressive behaviour
gene discovered us researchers never linked ethnic group
told new zealands national radio gene appeared feature 60 maori men compared 30 men european descent
believe gene influence behaviour humans general also believe influence rather small says
clear behavioural traits susceptibility addiction aggressive behaviour risk taking sort things extremely complex due numerous factors including nongenetic environmental factors like upbringing lifestyle factors
lea says gene explains issues involving maori
going aggressive violent likely get involved risktaking behaviour like gambling says although believes nongenetic factors might also play
lots lifestyle upbringingrelated exposures could relevant obviously gene wont automatically make criminal
maori mp hone harawira believes social issues including high unemployment poor educational achievement many cases severe poverty main contributors maori violence rather warrior gene
put group situation dare point group wouldnt aggressive result treated way
national urban maori authority chief executive john tamihere says open researchbased evidence whether genetic reason overrepresentation maori violence statistics
chromosomes today may ones well 15 million years mean future species
pending demise chromosome could give rise whole new species human professor comparative genomics says
scientists speculating demise chromosome years professor jenny graves australian national university canberra come bold new twist theory
graves working sex chromosomes marsupials present theory 11th international congress genetics brisbane today
tell conference new male making genes chromosomes could step job chromosomes sry gene key making males male
could mean men without chromosomes would split eventually evolving new species hominid
quite possible could make new hominid species way says
two populations become two species
graves says men without chromosome would largely infertile small number would reproduce pass new sex determining gene children
eventually group new gene would separate gene group potentially evolving new species says
two groups couldnt mate theyd get gradually different like chimpanzees humans gradually became different 5 million years ago says
two populations become two species theres generally theres sort wedge driven cant mate
might mountain range might something fundamental like way determine sex flipped new way
15 million years counting
graves says 45 working genes left chromosome grand total 1400
also contains lot pseudo genes look like work dont suggesting theyve recently become defunct
according projections chromosome disappear altogether 15 million years
occur unlike coupled genes single chromosome cant recombine matching partner less able refresh
mutations build mutated genes eventually drop chromosome longer perform useful function
graves says already happened case mole vole aggressive little rodent appears male able reproduce despite lost chromosome
xx men
australian researcher professor andrew sinclair murdoch childrens research institute researching socalled xx men roughly one 150000 men born without chromosome
pointing presence new genes havent yet discovered replace ones chromosome sinclair says
alternately volume previously existing genes may turned absence genes says
sinclairs team first world use new highdensity gene chips examine xx men hope finding genes
10 affected men also tiny portion chromosome stuck x chromosome carries across testis determining gene says
sinclair says graves theory new human species could make sense theoretical way unlikely reality
dont know whole new species human lost chromosome completely males would evolve way deal says
males without chromosome dont think id go far calling new species new type individual
study relied 50 ice cores collected range locations around antarctica
new study shows antarctic snowfalls changed little 50 years despite global warming could evidence worst yet come says one authors
study published today journal science reports contrary expectations snowfall antarctica increased past 50 years
contradicts predictions climate models based assumption warming air carry moisture produce greater snowfalls poles
models predict antarctic snowfall increasing warming atmosphere says australian team member palaeoclimatologist dr ian goodwin university newcastle
goodwin doesnt challenge basic climate physics says recent evidence supports idea recognised climate models lag global warming antarcticas response
reason antarctica southern hemisphere surrounded large oceans take long time heat therefore act buffer climate change
recent evidence suggests lag time could 60 years says goodwin
relatively complacent effects climate change southern hemisphere havent seen dramatic changes says
frightening thing think yet seeing full impact global warming southern hemisphere around corner
natural cycles
goodwin colleagues published study 1991 showed increase snowfall east antarctica
new study shows since amount snow falling area decreased
goodwin colleagues used direct measurement snowfall 50 ice cores reconstruct annual snowfall past 50 years
says study demonstrates previously unknown natural climate cycle affecting whole antarctica
one side antarctica decades see increase accumulation snow side antarctica see decrease balances zero net gain says
goodwin says variability great could mask changes due global warming
says could matter time natural cycle becomes dwarfed changes brought global warming
says lag time becomes important
rewrite paper say 10 years time likelihood actually writing paper says significant change antarctic snowfall last 10 15 years says goodwin
likelihood see next couple decades large response global warming antarctic southern ocean regions

people whose cheeks turn red thought speaking stranger similar blood flow everyone else
blushing takes longer subside obvious others australian research suggests
team researchers led professor peter drummond murdoch university western australia rated facial blood flow people frightened blushing performed everyday potentially squirmworthy tasks
included speaking stranger giving speech listening taped speech afterwards
researchers compared results group people werent frightened blushing performed tasks
found embarrassment selfreported blushing intensity greater fearofblushing group control group throughout experiment

researchers report online journal behaviour research therapy resulted incremental increase facial blood flow course experiment
drummond says differences blushing behaviour could come number factors
may difference way facial blood vessels respond social encounters fearful blushers prolongs increase facial blood flow difference way people cope slightly stressful situations says
may people frightened blushing simply anxious arent anxiety persists time afterwards takes little longer recover get back normal
may also blush response lingers longer theres opportunity person others notice says

either way drummond says research silver lining people worried blushing
social encounters blushing strongly frequently people dont feel blush much take longer recover
according drummond could simply result blushers thought process
theyre going possible ways could embarrassed social encounter says

process starts little dry wind dusty arid place kicks small dust grains collide larger sand grains kok explains
happens smaller grains steal electrons larger grains giving smaller grains negative charge larger grains positive charge
similar rubbing feet carpet become charged says kok case smaller grain carpet larger grain
next negatively charged smaller grains lifted ground breeze creating negatively charged region air positively charged ground separation charges electrical field

star ae aurigae surrounded dust may hiding deuterium complicating astronomers efforts study star galaxy formation
sixyear study primordial element created birth universe may force scientists revise theories stars galaxies formed
using telescope sensitive far ultraviolet light astronomers discovered much deuterium heavy form hydrogen created minutes big bang expected
models chemical evolution milky way revised significantly says astrophysicist professor jeffrey linsky university colorado boulder
deuterium ever existed believed forged within minutes big bang 137 billion years ago
deuterium heavy version regular hydrogen lightest abundant element nucleus harbours neutron addition normal proton twice hydrogens mass
stars consume deuterium known process create isotope serves tracer star formation galaxy creation throughout time
scientists thought knew much deuterium figuring onethird original deuterium remaining
according scientists using data far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer fuse
launched 1999 fuse telescope breaks light component wavelengths scientists determine chemicals phenomena beams might passed striking observatorys instruments
team provides first hard evidence deuterium attach interstellar dust grains well exist freefloating gas
finding explains deuterium spread evenly throughout galaxy instead appears clumps
solving one puzzle however laid groundwork far thornier question adding amount deuterium whether freeflying bound dust far expected
since 1970s unable explain deuterium levels vary place linsky says answer found unsettling exciting
fuse found presentday deuterium abundance less 15 primordial values rather 33
implies either significantly less material converted helium heavier elements stars much primordial gas rained onto galaxy lifetime thought says linsky
associate professor brian fields university illinois urbana says
fuse solved mystery deuterium scientists need try explain much
relative ancient marine organism used dig mud forming network tunnels
trilobites extinct marine creatures famous fossilhunters everywhere may done digging say uk swedish researchers
rocks found swedish limestone quarry contain remains trilobites inside networks tunnels appear subsurface thoroughfares little buglike organisms
rare find trilobite burrow says amherst colleges associate professor whitey hagadorn expert tracks burrows trace fossils give important clues longlost species behaviour environment
theres one fossil known says even one doesnt show evidence tunnels much singleuse oneway streets collapsed animals made way muck

may remnants neanderthal genes nuclear dna people european ancestors
people european descent may 5 neanderthal according dna study questions whether modern humans left africa replaced existing hominids
study published latest issue journal plos genetics also says west africans could related archaic human population
groups spread findings suggest bit archaic dna genes
instead population left africa 100000 years ago replaced archaic human groups propose population interacted another population europe much longer maybe 400000 years says vincent plagnol
plagnol researcher department molecular computational biology university southern california colleague assistant professor jeffrey wall analysed patterns ancestral linkage 135 modern individuals
looked people utah ancestors northern western europe yoruba people west africa
using statistics computer modelling researchers focused linkage disequilibriums sections within genes make sense modern human matings considered
missing genetic links fit hominid population introduced model scientists say
considered data modern human dna fitted model explain see explains plagnol
found simple model cannot explain data add ancestral population population cross modern humans almost effect small explain data find rate 5 needed explain see
researchers agree recent studies conclude neanderthals contribute mitochondrial dna mtdna genetic material passed mothers children
say portions european genome associated nuclear dna may still harbour neanderthal imprint
plagnol says different parts genome different ancestry individual could fraction certain chromosome inherited neanderthal possess typical homo sapiens mtdna
scientists certain early human group could contributed west african dna europeans africans study showed 5 archaic contribution
neanderthals believed originated africa around 400000 years ago left settled europe hence apparent lack interaction modern humans africa
alan templeton professor evolutionary population programs university michigan also conducted dna studies comes similar conclusions

scientists say study ancient rocks pilbara region western australia may force people rethink accepted theories prehistoric earths atmosphere developed
publish results today journal nature
generally accepted earths atmosphere devoid oxygen 80 existence
popular model little oxygen earths atmosphere 24 billion years ago says lead author professor hiroshi ohmoto pennsylvania state university
ohmotos team cast doubt theory finding sulfur isotopes indicating prevalent oxygen predate accepted start atmospheric oxygenation
key lies fact isotopes sulfur behave chemically slightly differing masses according amount atmospheric oxygen time
isotopes two sulfur samples team analysed one 276 billion years old lake bed 292 billion years old sea bed indicate oxygenstarved atmosphere
analysed sulfur composition could find abnormal sulfur isotope ratio indicating oxygen ohmoto says
first time sediment old found contain abnormal sulfur isotope ratio
team concludes several possible explanations
oxygen levels could fluctuated wildly millennia going oxygenless 3 billion years ago oxygenated 3 275 billion years ago back oxygenless 275 24 billion years ago
alternatively atmosphere could contained oxygen early 38 billion years ago sulfur usually associated oxygen might produced time violent volcanic activity
either way scientists say accepted theories atmosphere evolved needs reevaluated

new orleans houses swamped floodwaters hurricane katrina
year since levees broke new orleans scientists engineers found lot reasons hope despair future louisianas coast
good news solution may mississippi river
bad news coastal areas including new orleans could sinking lot faster expected maybe fast maybe
first theres murky mississippi water mark twain stint mississippi riverboat pilot reported glass fresh muddy river water considered wholesomer drink clear water ohio river account yaller mud
fact year great river carries 100 million tonnes per year silt sand gravel engineered channels past new orleans depths gulf mexico
thats equivalent 10 superdomes packed tight dirt year says denise reed professor geology geophysics university new orleans working finding solutions coast
year year 100 million tonnes adds whole lot real estate flowing freely right right place losing land 120 square kilometres year
going capinhand congress money valuable resource wasted reed says
instead artificially channelled southernmost tip mississippi delta dumped deeper waters muddy water sediment allowed flow shallow surf zones north would get caught neverending shoving match river sea
case along shoreline near river ocean waves would serve natures free earthmoving machines build beaches could protect land storm surf
process built louisiana coast first place reed says
mother lode still wasted says got keep shallow water
muddy process
kind project would keep liquid real estate louisiana time protecting homes cities maintaining navigable river restoring troubled mississippi delta wetlands
question focus feverish discussion planning louisianas brandnew coastal protection restoration authority cpr authority says robert twilley professor wetlands biogeochemistry louisiana state university lsu
back november two months katrina louisiana state legislature created cpr authority blending together state department natural resources state department transportation development
means says twilley first time protection usually means buildings integrated restoration usually refers coastal wetlands
decades two goals largely perceived opposites
completely changed overnight bedfellows says twilley really last year focused clear discussion levees wetlands integrated protection system
cpr authoritys first daunting task work various levee boards federal government craft comprehensive protection restoration plan louisiana coast
plan gleaned vast amounts data delivered public january twilley says
muddy mystery
one slippery yet fundamental aspects modelling planning figuring subsidence fast louisiana coast sinking whether anything
katrina struck last year scientists midst stormy debate subsidence twilley recalls
rates subsidence range less millimetre per year 170 times rate
geologists know least three things could causing ground sink lower along louisianas coast
one extraction oil gas water ground implicated last year us geological survey report
another somewhat limited natural settling compaction river sediments make ground
lastly deeper tectonic changes involving rising falling shifting large blocks real estate along faults sort thing thats common faultridden places like california
april twilleys lsu colleague professor roy dokka came paper geology argued faulting looks like gigantic slowmoving regional landslide cause almost threequarters new orleans subsidence
dokka revised regional elevation data using precision global positioning system equipment discovered higher rate subsidence past 50 years almost caused tectonic movement
july geology published paper tulane universitys associate professor torbjoumlrn toumlrnqvist used entirely different approach
toumlrnqvist surveyed longburied wetland peat layers outlying areas come entirely different milder subsidence rates
think balanced dialogue going says twilley two studies lot respect
way science works agrees reed surprising considering two studies different methods places examined says
discovering truth subsidence going take lot work great deal time dokka toumlrnqvist others already investing top speed
like people cpr authority army corps engineers levees boards everyone else along louisiana coast subsidence researchers urgently looking answers planners make right decisions everyone get work another katrinasized storm comes anywhere near

wide variety food helps brushtail possums eat eat without overloading bodies toxins
brushtail possums tell theyve eaten much favourite snacks according new research revealing uncanny ability regulate goes mouths
unlike humans pig chocolate hot chips make sick possums know exactly theyre starting overload system toxins says researcher dr karen marsh australian national university
theyre really good regulating intake knowing exactly much eat says marsupial herbivores
marsh reports recent issue journal ecology common brushtail possum trichosurus vulpecula thrives eats wide variety foods rather limited range
reasons unclear past
marsh says study supports one leading theories suggests possums better able neutralise small amounts naturally occurring toxins variety foods hightoxin load single food
food toxins
plantbased diet brushtail possum eats foods contain nutrients potentially toxic byproducts
neutralises various ways example oxidising toxins converting different molecules
possum eats one food reach threshold particular toxin faster selects wider smorgasbord
basically seem able recognise whether toxins similar different feed accordingly marsh says
think happens toxins activate emetic pathways body possums start feel sick detox pathways get saturated
getting rid toxins
marsh tested hypothesis identifying various toxin thresholds possums working eliminated analysing metabolites urine
offered possums range foods similar toxin pathways range foods different pathways
found possums ate less foods activated similar pathways
marsh says important understand mechanisms regulate diet possums help conservation

wreaths laid steve irwin died stingrays barb heart filming documentary north queensland
weeks mass grieving response death australian crocodile hunter steve irwin part fairly recent phenomenon dependent mass media say experts
make sense public grieving loss someone never met
generally think grief associated loss people close like family member says psychologist grant brecht australian psychological society
says feel close someone never met come know like appearances media
conjure mind feelings thoughts person would like says brecht
die respond fact know
experience grief almost level may well family member says brecht
people would felt affinity steve says bit australian icon bit australian larrikin someone seemed quite affinity animals us would respect
brecht says mourning healthy part dealing feeling loss
us remember spontaneous outpourings exhibited death princess diana grieving hasnt always public affair
recent phenomenon
australian national university historian professor pat jalland says mass public grieving really taken since 1970s
equivalent princess diana died 40 years earlier guarantee would resulted anything like happened says
jalland says last period history grieving accepted activity 19th century advent mass media
time death claimed many infant lives grieving occurred religious rituals
1918 1970s public grieving suppressed says jalland
part helped decline infant mortality meant death mainly happened old age behind closed doors home eventually hospital
silence death
suppression grief also helped decline religious ritual period major wars soldiers implication us expected bear death stoicism says jalland
two world wars created massive overload death sorrow induced freud others call death denial silence death says
emotional responses suppressed
time media coverage sudden tragic deaths factual lacked personal stories common today says jalland
says changed 1970s huge cultural shift towards open displays emotion
shift encouraged womens gay liberation movements says jalland psychologists like elisabeth kublerross encouraged open discussion death dying
encouraged mass media showed grief normal response tragedy reporting personal stories involved
secular spirituality
dr david ritchie deakin university special interest grief education says good side mass media facilitated grief gives people permission grieve
says important society people seldom die home rituals around death peoples main experience death media
idea death part life cycle really foreign says ritchie also management committee australian centre grief bereavement
ritchie says spontaneous outpourings grief company strangers helps people make sense shocking nature sudden death
making shrines flowers photos artwork poetry lighting candles sharing stories person died helps make people feel connected empowered says ritchie
part secular spirituality
ritchie doesnt see mass public grieving anything like grief close family member
always see steve irwin looking films says
always press rewind button put tape back thats knew
different family says ritchie
says person experiences grief differently one size fits version sanctioned mass media could lead inauthentic experiences grief
people died bird flu virus vietnamese study virus blood suggesting could transported respiratory tract
h5n1 bird flu virus replicates far aggressively people common human flu viruses study patients vietnam found offering insight virus deadly
study published online journal nature medicine also found virus gets blood stream many humans kills means virus spread parts body
dr menno de jong oxford university clinical research unit vietnams hospital tropical diseases ho chi minh city says unusually high viral loads trigger intense cytokine responses immune system overreaction fatal
cytokines proteins immune system fight intruders bacteria viruses
h5n1 infection cytokine response seems intense cytokines want get rid intruder high levels cytokines also damage body directed cells organs says de jong
study involved 18 people infected h5n1 eight human flu 2004 2005 vietnam
scientists found far higher viral loads nose throats infected bird flu human flu
thirteen infected h5n1 died virus found blood least nine suggesting could transported respiratory tract
virus also found rectums h5n1 suggesting could spread blood stream gastrointestinal tract
common flu virus blood rectum one died group
fatal outcome h5n1 infections seems associated high levels replication virus also detection virus blood says de jong
team able draw connection ill level cytokines found

next time go sports game large openair stadium listen weather forecast say meteorologists
large openair stadiums could severe weather death traps says us meteorologist new study lightning storms sports stadiums
people struck lightning stadiums us stadium suffered direct tornado hit game
university colorado scientist says stadiums immune dangers stadium managers something prevent calamity
infamous case poorly handled lightning storm big stadium 1998 virginia tech game rkf stadium washington dc reports joel gratz september issue bulletin american meteorological society
lightning struck killed one woman caused numerous injuries 50000 people panicked raced chaotically escape stadium narrow tunnels
stadiums jammed tunnels left many people open without protection
next 10 minutes 16 lightning strikes within mile stadium says gratz
went wrong stadium managers plan police ushers unprepared help people find cover stadium speaker system inadequate lightning evacuation plan says gratz
ironically reason lightning plans simple odds miniscule lightning strike stadium game way gratz says
statistically may make lot sense look says gratz points odds also low terrorist attacks given stadium yet plans place
lightning also one lowrisk highimpact events
cant activate terrorist plan lightning storm approaches expect help gratz explains
unlike terrorist threat moving people carpark open field electrical storm probably hurt people says
whats needed evacuation plans use lightningprotected places inside stadium nearby buildings well better monitoring approaching weather stadium officials says
spectators prevent trouble paying better attention severe weather warnings acting says meteorologist professor william gallus iowa state university
gallus got firsthand look tricky severe weather warnings stadiums tornado threatened jack trice stadium ames iowa last november
tornado touched 15 miles 24 kilometres away live tv says gallus
tailgaters stadium carpark watching portable televisions says
yet little comprehension among spectators stadium officials 80 kilometres per hour tornado could potentially reach stadium minutes
event could tragedy says gallus
fortunately tornado hit stadium time
people need realise need take personal responsibility safety says
indeed certain tendency spectators put blinkers gratz says
go stadium spectator people weather information pdas cell phones one really going notice bright lights game electrical storm 15 miles away
gratz admits fallen prey blindness game denvers invesco stadium father called mobile phone asked knowledgeable weather person sitting open stadium along 50000 people nasty electrical storm closing

thats bats congregate large noisy crowds produce foulsmelling guano
animosity bad enough common people shoot flying foxes however local northern queensland species protected permit required kill
particular species one smallest distribution believed smallest population shilton says
scattered killed
shilton pretty certain bats scattered rather killed cyclone visited known roosting sites found dead animals handful compared 10000 around storm
people reported seeing bats hurrying away en masse storm arrived probably natural response quickly dropping air pressure
would agree queensland probably offer places flying foxes escape storm says dr kim mcconkey wildlife researcher studied effects another cyclone another species flying foxes tonga

new research suggests fall methane emissions partly attributed diminishing wetlands temporary
chinas booming economy wetlands northern hemisphere emerged key factors could future escalation emissions greenhouse gas methane according new research
study methane emissions published journal nature today reports atmospheric methane increased past seven years dropping 1990s
paper says chinas growing economy including flourishing coal industry may behind increase methane emissions human activity
offset drop natural emissions swamps bogs wetlands drying result prolonged drought
drying trend reversed emissions wetlands return normal atmospheric methane levels may increase worsening problem climate change says one reports authors australian researcher dr paul steele
steele senior research scientist csiro marine atmospheric research says paper isnt making firm predictions
pointing prospect emissions increase says
methane menace
steele says methane second important greenhouse gas carbon dioxide
6 million tonnes methane emitted air year although atmosphere rid chemical processes including oxidative effects hydroxyl radicals
methane emitted result natural human activity primary natural source methane rotting wetland vegetation belching sheep cattle
also produced decaying landfill exploitation fossil fuels including drilling oil coal mining
captured marketed methane turned alternative energy source poorly managed escapes atmosphere contribute global warming
estimated responsible fifth enhanced greenhouse effect past 200 years steele says
says unclear much atmospheric methane comes natural sources much human activity
might know total fairly well dont good handle partition total amongst range sources says
accompanying editorial dr jos lelieveld director max planck institute chemistry germany says twothirds global methane currently comes human activity
says atmospheric methane grew rate 10 per decade 1980 dropped almost zero 1990s
coal mines wetlands
steele says one effects prolonged drought drying wetlands particularly northern hemisphere
bogs swamps emit methane theyve got rotting decaying vegetation base water says
dry emission methane stops slows
economic growth coal mining activity asian countries like china largely driven hunger electricity appears making deficit
coal mining release methane atmosphere without safeguards steele says

dogs like sports celebrities watch dogs play fight hang winners
dogs seem enjoy watching dogs compete gravitate towards winners end game according recent study
uk researchers publish research journal animal behaviour believe discovery first demonstration animal eavesdropping play
case dogs appear gain information another dog humans social status ability watching individual compete
pooches excitedly rush toward victors games finish unlike enthusiastic human sports fans stadium
believe within context game dogs prefer winners likely fun effective partner play says lead author dr nicola rooney
one plausible function play serves safe context test ones competitive ability animal learn playing able partner lower quality one adds rooney researcher anthrozoology institute university bristol
colleague dr john bradshaw studied 18 canine spectators group included labrador retrievers springer spaniels one golden retriever
initial experiment dog matched human competitor tug war contest knotted rope toy canine spectators brought leash view matches
games human competitor made clear playing performing moves dogs seem associate playtime
include play bows person gets fours forequarters lowered arms outstretched forward lunges individual makes sudden yet nonthreatening movements toward dog competitor feet shuffling involves rapid movement feet standing position
competitions spectator canine would rapidly approach human doggy winner cheerful gait holding ears tail signifying desire interact victor
playful moves omitted matches dogs attracted winners since probably thought games real competitions winner might pose threat
followup experiment rooney bradshaw repeated first part study time spectator dog confined crate heard proceedings
matches listeners still gravitated toward winner suggests audio cues possibly asyet unidentified cues smells might also allow dogs identify winners losers
research partly funded waltham centre pet nutrition research centre popular pet food company

mature cells retain genetic capacity grow cell types needed regenerate entire organism scientists say
scientists say cloned mice white blood cells similar technique used create dolly sheep
us researchers publish results online journal nature genetics say method shows possible clone animals mature cells
say findings counter argument truly mature tissue old regenerated
dr jerry yang university connecticut dr tao cheng university pittsburgh colleagues cloned mice using fully differentiated mature white blood cells called granulocytes
used somatic cell nuclear transfer nucleus cell animal cloned injected egg whose nucleus removed
process works poorly mice usually twostep procedure needed first growing tiny embryos removing embryonic stem cells generate mouse pups
yangs team tried cloning using blood cells various levels development stem cells stage full maturity called full differentiation
surprising efficiency went got differentiated cells yang says
surprising shocking us
fully mature granulocytes able produce two live cloned pups although died within hours birth researchers report
even surprised find fully differentiated cells efficient cloning granulocytes capable dividing cheng says

chemical process makes breakfast cereal tasty also make less nutritious according recent study
result puffs contain less nutritionally available protein flakes researchers report journal food chemistry
difference cooking technique spanish study suggests
future researchers say findings may lead healthier preparation methods cold cereals processed foods
dr francisco morales led research says chemical process called maillard reaction affects flavour nutrition cereals
reaction usually induced heat sugars amino acids interact produce odour flavour molecules
gives many foods characteristic toasty golden brown qualities
also reduces bioavailability nutrients lead formation contaminants says morales scientist instituto del friacuteo madrid
colleagues studied 60 packaged cold cereals measuring amount chemical produced maillard reaction furosine furosine means less nutritionally available protein
researchers found significant differences among wheat rice cornbased cereals
flaked cereals tended less furosine puffed varieties
manufacturing process flakes puffs similar boiling ingredients followed drying toasting
puffs need cooked higher temperatures get characteristic airy texture higher temperatures fuel stronger maillard reaction
surprisingly cereals added dietary fibre highest furosine levels

scientists used computers analyse shakespeare used certain words phrases come unique linguistic signature
computational fingerprint uniquely characterises william shakespeares writing style helping dispel lingering doubts penned plays
method could analyse plays attributed shakespeare anonymous controversial writings authors
people take programs use design go 19th century talk lord byron says professor arthur kinney director massachusetts center renaissance studies university massachusetts amherst
kinney leads research australias professor hugh craig director centre literary linguistic computing university newcastle
researchers built massive database containing tens thousands words shakespeares works well works playwrights time
used method called computational stylistics analyse usage occurrence spelling placement phrases well common rare words
example word gentle appears almost twice frequently works shakespeare works writers shakespearean drama frequently finds word farewell preceded hail
computational fingerprint created known works compared fingerprints unknown works see match
doubts
controversy whether shakespeare ordinary working class man countryside could authored remarkable writing began percolating middle 19th century
doubt ability suggest another educated man earl oxford edward devere penned plays would earl attribute shakespeare deflect criticism claim
early part 1600s gathering large crowd theatre signalled political unrest made government officials nervous christian groups puritans found theatre immoral
plenty evidence suggest shakespeare write plays
one shakespeare apparently wrote plays 1611 earl oxford died 1601
also least four different publishers put shakespeares dramas print author would keep secret
people involved conspiracy likely would somebody would blown whistle says professor gary taylor director history text technologies florida state university
kinney craigs computational method adds scientific credence mix

australian discovery
fusion power reactors dream many since australian sir mark oliphant discovered nuclear fusion process powers sun stars 1934
fusion involves release energy combination two light atomic nuclei typically isotopes hydrogen
energy scientists hope harness safe greenhousefriendly economic form power
hole says nuclear fusion would produce energy cost comparable nuclear fission environmental impact comparable wind power
many challenges significant energy required force two positively charged atomic nuclei together plasma gas charged particles must kept hot dense long enough undergo fusion
one challenge confine plasma must kept temperatures around heat sun
doughnutshaped magnetic fields
iter fusion reactor called tokomak originally designed russia pioneered west australia
tokomak fuses ions hydrogen deuterium tritium confined doughnutshaped magnetic field temperatures 100000000ºc
hole says unlike previous plasma physics experiments iter produce energy consumes special conditions even produce 30 times energy consumes
says various technologies developed australia could contribute iter despite australias early leadership fusion science risks missing unless officially part frenchbased project
hole says relevant australian expertise includes ability diagnose going reactor including measuring temperatures
measuring temperatures 100 million degrees example simple exercise says
australia also expertise developing materials handle high temperatures involved says hole
currently hole says a13 million spent fusion research australia increased a16 million competitive us uk commitment
concerns
energy commentator dr mark diesendorf sustainability centre sydney concerned government could invest fusion expense lowgreenhouse energy sources likely deliver quickly
diesendorf says could big payoff fusion technology risky chance plasma becoming unstable energy try get system
antinorth korea protesters chant slogans protest denouncing norths nuclear device test scientists say looks like dud
two days north korea claimed exploded nuclear weapon scientists edged towards conclusion test indeed nuclear failure
failure unlikely derail north koreas nuclear program could even help pyongyangs bomb makers warn
two main sources scientific evidence needed confirm blast nuclear
one shockwave sent back ground detectors
fallout radioactive particles gases often escape underground test site even tunnel shaft sealed tight
north koreas blast tiny seismic wave almost indistinguishable routine subterranean background noise experts say
means take long time harnessing supercomputers minds top physicists find telltale spikes confirm blast nuclear say stockpile tnt blown hoax
series differentiations done sift blast background noise says xavier clement frances atomic energy commission
possible cannot done given weakness signals compared background noise says
absence far known radiological evidence scientists also note small size north koreas explosion
russia described blast fullfledged nuclear event equivalent 515 kilotonnes tnt
meanwhile norwegian institute seismology norsar describes mediumsized bomb 110 kilotonnes
national monitors put less 1 kilotonne one figure little 200 tonnes
low yields feasible nuclear warhead traditionally reserved established members nuclear club mastered arts miniaturisation
easiest size weapon build 1020 kilotonnes harder build one thats smaller harder build one thats larger says james acton vertic independent uk watchdog carries research verification international treaties
seems technically unlikely politically unlikely north korea would tried anything first test 1020 kilotonne range says acton cambridgeeducated nuclear physicist
nuclear test yield less kilotonne seems evidence test fizzle partially unsuccessful test
clement agrees turns nuclear test clear weakness energy release corresponds explosion fell short could expected says
test failed went wrong
assumption among experts north korea used plutonium rather uranium make bomb given plutoniummaking reactor fuel rods known possession
uranium bombs like little boy dropped hiroshima 1945 bombs relatively easy make uranium slug fired ball uranium achieve critical mass
plutonium bombs complicated entail small ball plutonium like centre onion swathed conventional explosives
explosives compress plutonium fire neutron mass initiate chain reaction
explosives must carefully shaped detonation must precisely timed ensure neutron fired right time says acton
another possibility still realm hypothesis material used test impurities plutonium isotopes emit neutrons caused chain reaction start prematurely
whatever happened none problems way terminally fatal program cautions acton

isnt cockroach ate dallas recent history asks coauthor professor jon harrison arizona state university answer question without time machine
harrison team analysed modern insects designed fact air today 21 oxygen
focused tracheal system interconnected tubes transport oxygen throughout bug bodies
extension researchers envisioned insects would looked like millions years ago air 35 oxygen
findings help explain remains millipedes metre long 10 centimetre cockroaches dragonflies 75 centimetre wingspans dating late palaeozoic period dinosaurs came scene
using xray imaging scientists compared tracheal dimensions four modern beetles ranging size 3 millimetres 35 centimetres
found tracheal system took 20 insects body larger beetles words bigger insect must invest air tubing
tracheae mean less space everything else body brain reproductive system harrison explains
oxygenrich world palaeozoic era insects needed less air meet oxygen needs result could afford smaller trachea modern insects
researchers conclude although palaeozoic insects basic body structure modern insects maximum body size larger smaller trachea left room essential body parts necessary sustain weight

recent studies suggested caffeine measure choice counteract effects sleep deprivation alertness performance say dr julie carrier montreals sacred heart hospital colleagues
results suggest recommendation made caution since using caffeine sleeping abnormal circadian phase night work might adverse consequences sleep quality sleeping normal circadian time
drinking caffeine night known make difficult fall asleep worsen sleep quality carrier team note
hypothesised caffeine would even stronger effect people trying recover sleep deprivation snoozing day
investigate asked 34 people drink caffeine placebo going sleep normal bedtime
month later people deprived sleep entire night told fall asleep hour normal wakeup time given placebo caffeine
people received 100 milligrams caffeine placebo scheduled morning evening bedtime another 100 milligrams placebo one hour
sleeping caffeine
study participants took caffeine took longer fall asleep spent time lighter stage 1 sleep less time deeper stage 2 slowwave sleep researchers found
people given caffeine daytime sleep took even longer drop also slept shorter total time less rem sleep caffeine didnt affect night time sleep duration rem

horned beetles big weapons big testes
beetles biggest horns smallest testes say scientists show evolutionary terms cant
say finding clear evidence evolutionary tradeoff ability fight sexual competitors reproductive potency
put simply ability find mate ability fertilise
professor leigh simmons university western australia us researcher professor douglas emlen university montana publish findings online today proceedings national academy sciences
researchers looked beetles genus onthophagus dung beetles known size variety horns
test fundamental assumption underlying evolution males face tradeoff competing access lots females investment gaining fertilisation females simmons says
need big horns win fights get females need big testes order win sperm competition
cant species invest heavily horns tend invest less testes
study also demonstrates theory sperm competition occurs females mate one partner simmons says
according theory male rivalry continues mate found sperm different males compete fertilise egg
theory predicts males increase investment sperm production sperm competition increased says
manipulating horns
simmons tested theory cauterising area developing beetle pupa horns would grow destroying cells preventing horn growth
found horn development inhibited pupa compensated developing larger testes
principle known resource allocation tradeoff says
got fixed amount resources allocate various structures legs wings horns testes important organs says
developing beetle doesnt produce horns males produce bigger testes resources werent used horn growth
examples
simmons says principle resource allocation demonstrated animal studies
example evidence bats trade size testes brain power
recent study showed stalkeyed flies eye span width measure sexual desirability trade testes size width eyes

latest study best time year shear sheep overturns 20 years thinking
farmers want produce better quality wool dont necessarily need shear sheep autumn australian researchers found
angus campbell phd student university melbourne colleagues show theres particular shearing season consistently improves wool strength
finding could important implications australias multibillion dollar wool industry
past 20 years many farmers sheared sheep autumn hope getting better quality fibres higher price wool
idea behind wool gets thinner summer thickens late autumn campbell says
would make wool stronger would thin end thicker stronger middle
test theory campbell colleagues designed study used real life conditions two commercial merino farms west geelong victoria
year five years sheared 1000 ewes lambs three different seasons measured quality wool
onethird sheep shorn december onethird march another third may
three realistic shearing times based research talking wool growers says
result wool strength three shearing times campbell says
connection wool fibre thickness season nutrition weather researcher explains
summer fibres tend get thinner flocks rely dried feed rains autumn bring proteinrich green grass makes wool quickly get thicker
spring many farmers sheep bearing lambs similar thing happens ewes devote energy growing lamb wool
means among ewes lambs annual shearing time going consistently shear weak part fibre campbell says
way results good news farmers says
means farmer really good reason choosing shearing time based something specific farm reckon go ahead worry harming wool value says
campbells research form part phd submitted later year

brain damage improve artistic skills also make paintings less emotional everyone potential become next picasso
damage particular part brain trigger artistic talent us neurologists show
looked one particular artist whose frontal temporal lobes brain deteriorated found developed new artistic skills
us researchers published study artistic effects frontotemporal lobar dementia latest issue journal neurology
reports previously inartistic people becoming talented visual artists developing condition
clear whether brain atrophy releasing dormant talent disease somehow triggered artistic expression
investigate dr valeria drago university florida gainesville others studied art woman artist developing type brain damage
womans condition worsened found artistic technique improved emotional power work decreased
really follow paintings changed following disease says drago
drago team gathered 40 womans paintings including several period developed symptoms symptoms beginning painted later
researchers gave 18 men women training evaluate six different artistic qualities asked rate paintings
ratings paintings artistic skill rose womans disease progressed
ratings paintings evocative impact closure fell
evocative impact ability work art elicit emotional reaction closure sense painting finished complete
drago team note condition leaves parts brain work drawing painting skills relatively intact
part brain disease affect may typically inhibit region brain damaged artistic talents freer rein suggest
researchers also point patients form brain damage may damage limbic system network within brain essential mediating emotions

champion racehorse phar lap died 70 years ago scientific test sparked fresh debate caused demise melbourne museum
claims champion australian racehorse phar lap killed arsenic poisoning premature says expert cast doubt reports today science solved one nations biggest sporting mysteries
professor rob lewis director monash university centre synchrotron science says many ifs whats wherefores declare case phar laps unexplained death shut
lewis seen results synchrotron analysis phar laps hair conducted us says research preliminary
says early tell whether arsenic detected hair chemical used taxidermy process preserve horse results foul play
phar lap 1930 melbourne cup champion one australias greatest sporting icons died 1932 shortly winning americas richest race agua caliente handicap
exact cause death never proved although speculation work gangsters
dr ivan kempson research fellow based university south australia came idea using synchrotron analyse phar laps hair
analysis far indicates probably consume dose arsenic prior death says
kempson says analysis advanced photon source synchrotron near chicago shows two forms arsenic
one lead arsenide could associated preservation says likely result ingestion
type arsenic consistent distribution location chemistry ingesting arsenic 3040 hours prior death says
weve going process trying prove wrong look alternative explanations far results consistent consuming arsenic
horse hair samples
lewis says work needed analyse samples stuffed horse preserved public display melbourne museum
nobodys ever actually analysed hair animal thats stuffed long says
really need prove kind thing 20 horses stuffed check find major problem one say ones different case weve got one
given dont actually understand exactly procedure used preserve phar lap know whether stuff used preserving whether given beforehand
lewis says synchrotrons closely analyse structure chemicals like arsenic
synchrotron without shadow doubt gives information could got ways whether conclusive would stand court law personally doubts says
sorts things dont quite know dont know process used tanning hide dont know happened condition arsenic years since phar lap died
things oxidise things change bugs get sorts things change biological materials dont stay clearly sort thing might happened
kempson says research planned hopefully finally lay case rest including comparison similar cases
far phar laps sample compared stuffed monkey says
synchrotron
lewis describes synchrotron particle accelerator essentially large xray machine concentrate large number xrays onto tiny object like single hair
xrays produced particles accelerated around large ring close speed light particles pass magnetic fields ring emit rays approximately billion times brighter sun
case instead looking xrays go straight hair look xrays scatter come different directions says
xrays carry information things like arsenic chemistry arsenic

youtube legend careful videos dont get legal hot water
internet law experts called australian copyright laws amended people post online videos miming pop songs without risking prosecution
researcher damien obrien professor brian fitzgerald queensland university technology qut say miming copyright material posting online may currently illegal
explore copyright law relation popular youtube site internet law bulletin
video sharing website youtube hosts 65000 new videos every day many made amateurs
12 year old girl uploads video lipsyncing latest shakira pop song onto youtube served copyright infringement notice write
breached copyright law answer say yes
certainly many videos uploaded onto youtube probably infringe copyright theyre reproductions communications whole even little bit original
obrien says prosecutions australia yet major music companies particularly us active demanding videos removed youtube
calls change
says amendments australian copyright law currently considered parliament fail take cases like amateur miming account
obrien says types reproduction allowed fair trading provisions amendments dont cover cases like one highlighted paper
hes arguing defence material highly transformative competing original market
would allow 12 year old amateur upload video miming sound track impunity
doesnt radical change amendments something allows someone remix small amount someone elses work put different context long commercial purposes doesnt compete original says
pretty hard see something like shouldnt allowed

botai village horse yards would looked like
evidence soil inside remains 5600yearold horse yard indicates ancient botai people kazakhstan among earliest domesticate horses
botai probably ate milked horses often rode
horse yards part archaeological site northern kazakhstan known krasnyi yar
large village occupied copper age botai says dr sandra olsen curator carnegie museum natural history pittsburgh leads team investigating horse domestication years
associate professor rosemary capo geologist colleague university pittsburgh presented soil evidence horses week geological society america meeting philadelphia
really dont understand major signs changes horses domestication says dr melinda zeder archaeologist smithsonian institution specialises origins animal plant domestication
zeder refers physical changes horse bones ancient middens
far direct way determine people horses early says
reasons colleagues building case less direct evidence
heres approach documenting horse domestication thats extremely new says zeder evidence presented conference sort like perry mason theyre building circumstantial evidence
evidence comes circular arrangements posts soil differences found inside outside horse yard
comparing soils
inside yard soil contained 10 times phosphorus outside soils lower concentrations nitrogen thats youd expect soil inside yard enriched horse manure
modern horse manure comparison loaded phosphorous potassium nitrogen nitrogen easiest lose groundwater air
phosphorus hand held place calcium iron says capo one scientists analysed soil
high phosphorous could also indicate human occupation says capo thats usually accompanied geochemical signatures didnt find horse yard samples
also high sodium concentration horse yard samples could urine suggests olsen

antechinus females go extraordinary lengths make sure offspring survive
female marsupials sex many males possible produce fittest healthiest offspring australian researchers report
brown antechinus antechinus stuartii usually breeds life added pressure make sure young best chance surviving
researchers report todays issue journal nature mouselike marsupial stores sperm many suitors two weeks ova ducts
sperm strongest males go fertilise prized eggs result may eight healthy offspring sired four strong males
dr diana fisher colleagues australian national university conducted two separate mating experiments
first took female marsupials wild season allowed mate either single male three different males every two days
year later replicated experiment kept lactating females captivity weaning
allowed researchers determine whether previous benefit polyandry depended stressful conditions natural habitat could replicated laboratory
found females populations werent particularly fussy given chance mated happily multiple partners
males avoided wild obviously picked males perceived weak
experimentally assigning mates females able show polyandry females mating one male mating season greatly increases offspring survival fisher says
dna profiling shows males gain high paternity sperm competition sire offspring viable
many females animal plant world mate multiple partners researchers loss explain practice costly terms egg production disease injury
earlier studies suggested polyandry yielded genetic benefits could increase offspring survival reasons unclear effects yet proved mammals wild
researchers conclude practice polyandry leads better quality offspring important factor light fact marsupial usually breed lifetime

nasa discussing whether shuttle mission repair hubble space telescope worth risk
time money anguish work return space shuttle fleet flight us space agency still one lingering question resolve shuttle mission sent save hubble
2003 columbia disaster fifth servicing call hubble space telescope probably would happened
mission would left 16yearold observatory fresh batteries replacement gyroscopes steering two new science instruments
upgrades could keep hubble cutting edge astronomical research delving questions nature mysterious dark energy seems driving universes expansion universe looked like earliest structures emerged big bang
columbia accident shuttle flights go space station astronauts seek shelter case ship damaged fly home considered risky hubble house call cancelled
nasa looked robotic servicing mission instead found cost complexity mission daunting
meanwhile public outrage nasas decision let popular space telescope fester culminating pledge new head nasa reconsider flying one last flight hubble
three postcolumbia flights complete time come decide hubbles fate
nasa considering safety upgrades implemented accident offset risk flying options available save stranded shuttle crew
hubble definitely sort comeback kid hopefully able one time says professor adam riess astronomer space telescope science institute baltimore
would expect final meeting adds matter coming decision
shuttle program workers certainly done homework
first order business fix problems debris falling ships fuel tank launch
chunk insulating foam broke columbias tank liftoff smashed hole wings heat shield
shuttle attempted return earth 16 days later superheated atmospheric gases blasted breach destroying shuttle killing seven astronaut crew
nasas first tank redesign tested july 2005 flight shuttle discovery failed prevent dangerously large pieces foam falling tank second redesign tested year later time tank deemed safe enough resume flights
shuttle program also demonstrated ships robot arm newly added extension boom could used flight scrutinise shuttles heat shield damages
astronauts also tested using boom work platform case repairs needed fix heat shield holes attempting atmospheric reentry
finally engineers developed rudimental heat shield repair kits techniques
getting around issue flying without orbital safe hubbles orbit far station shuttle get
theoretically nasa could severely cut shuttle power keep crew orbit several weeks another shuttle could launched rescue mission guarantee flight could launched time another problem might also strike rescue ship
dont orbital lifetime hubble mission able get another vehicle launched says deputy shuttle program manager john shannon
going go hubble decision counting launchonneed vehicle says
thats difficult question agencys going enough confidence tank design enough confidence inspection repair able think thats discussion mostly going lie
another issue whether risk shuttle crew hubble flight nasa strict deadline finish space station 2010 shuttles retired
agency needs least 14 construction missions wants two additional flights beyond deliver heavy equipment spare parts outpost
recently released flight schedule agency managers set aside hubble servicing mission april 2008
station assembly resumed last months flight shuttle atlantis would complete july 2010 new manifest
without servicing mission astronomers expect hubble last another two three years batteries give even finicky gyroscopes could break cameras could fail
would really blow says astronomer dr harry ferguson also space telescope science institute think everyone really quite hopeful repair mission happen waiting bated breath
gets upgrades hubble last least 2013 means could still operational sharpeyed infrared replacement james webb space telescope arrives orbit begin fiveyear mission

industrial aerosols dont affect air quality also temperature oceans
projected drop air pollution affect global ocean currents could cause marked rise water temperature southern hemisphere author new study says
dr wenju cai colleagues csiro marine atmospheric research first model impact changing levels particulate air pollution aerosols ocean currents
publish findings journal geophysical research letters
cai says air pollution like sulfate organic particles black carbon produced fossil fuel burning transport emissions power plants increased rapidly past 50 years
tighter regulation worldwide move towards cleaner fuels means projections aerosols dropping pre1960 levels around 2050 cai says
however downside less air pollution means sunlight easily reach earth many researchers say could mean higher temperatures
cai says rises surface water temperature could also cause slowdown socalled worldwide conveyor belt ocean circulation system transports heat southern hemisphere oceans north
cleaner air result colder northern hemisphere temperatures warmer waters south cai says
big impact europe northern hemisphere conveyor belt sending heat part globe says
southern hemisphere get warmer faster rise sea levels accelerate
cai says warming rapid tasman sea could heat 4176c 2100 major implications marine life ecosystems
aerosols influence ocean currents
aerosols keep earth cool reflecting away solar radiation says cais coauthor csiro colleague dr john church thought mask effects global warming
industrial development produced higher concentration aerosols northern hemisphere south past cooling effect marked north
cooler northern hemisphere temperatures mean cooler northern oceans cooler waters equate lower sea levels
wasnt case says church instead study found evidence cooling waters intensified movement conveyer belt speeding delivery heat south north
reversal
situation may reverse aerosol levels fall cai says effectively causing slowdown transport heat southern hemisphere north
cai says exaggerated version scenario basis hollywood movie day tomorrow change ocean currents produces new ice age
church says unclear exactly dropping aerosol levels affect global temperatures combined rising temperatures associated greenhouse effect
dont understand aerosol forcing well greenhouse theres question much global warming compensated aerosols says
small amount reduce aerosols atmosphere wont rapid acceleration climate change theyre actually masking large amount reduce aerosols big implications
australia developing worlds first koala sperm bank
zoos around world soon able breed koalas without fly breeding stock australia researchers say
say new technology preserve sperm allow koala sperm exported australia first time
university queensland reproductive biologist team leader dr steve johnston says researchers able extend shelf life sperm 40 hours
theyve done diluting semen special ph balanced solution containing nutrients antibiotics keeping chilled
team week unveiled eight koala joeys born artificial insemination diluted semen
able dilute semen first step able provide frozen specimens internationally interstate johnston says
fresh koala semen lasts couple hours fragility cells means dont easily survive freezing thawing
team plans set worlds first koala sperm bank
koalas camels common
johnston says koalas like camels special factor sperm triggers ovulation female
found theres combination mating factor semen causes brain release luteinising hormone results ovulation process says
diluting semen without affecting ovulation factor major challenge researchers says
diluting first step youre going freeze something put diluent allows put cryoprotectants fluid protect sperm freezing says
thing dilute sperm dont use much dont waste much sperm inseminating
low sperm count
koalas relatively low sperm count 100 million sperm per ejaculation compared echidnas 10 times amount
johnston says able send frozen sperm sample internationally make easier introduce genetic diversity koala populations
setting sperm bank help conservation efforts australia enable samples screened common koala diseases like chlamydia retroviruses
dont hold breath buying koala sperm online johnston says
queensland government making sure none happen
mathematicians say cake eat youre prepared sums
mathematicians devised fairer way share cake according new research
allows choose slice chocolate icing tradeoff get smaller piece
research based principle surplus procedure published notices american mathematical society
traditional way dividing cake cut choose approach one person cuts cake two chooses half write professor michael jones colleagues montclair state university new jersey
ensures people get sized portion doesnt necessarily mean equally happy
example one may like chocolate icing sprinkles cream
surplus procedure
even researchers propose people tell referee much value certain qualities cake
referee uses weighted values calculate cut cake
ideal world parties would get 100 want reality theres compromise
jones says teams algorithms ensure parties get 65 want based principle giving person least 50 cake plus surplus value
catch system depends honesty requires referee calculator
surplus procedure system used two three people jones says doesnt work quite well three
says method also applied heterogeneous divisible items like dividing land deciding much rent flatmate pays
wedge system
dr burkard polster australian mathematician monash university isnt convinced proposed method best
associate number something like happiness says
really wanted sell 10 year old wouldnt go theyd still think piece better
says square cake example cut five fairly using equation says area triangle equals length base times height divided two
cake cant cut equal squares four pieces cant cut parallel pieces pieces edge icing cake iced around edge top
answer cut cake equally sized wedges
cake perimeter 50 centimetres start one corner measure 10 centimetres make mark go around youre back beginning five marks
marks cut middle wedges exactly one fifth
eggs sandwiches
polster says applying surplus procedure cakes isnt first time maths used share food

presented jumbosized mirror elephants recognise reflections investigate inside mouths ears according new study
selfawareness rare paper published online today proceedings national academy sciences scientists believed humans apes dolphins possessed selfrecognition skills
animals highly intelligent seem feel empathy quality probably linked selfawareness
common complex sociality includes high levels cooperation altruism large brains says coauthor dr frans de waal psychology professor emory university atlanta
literature human children speculation increased selfawareness makes possible set self apart others turn permits self take others perspective prerequisite complex forms empathy says de waal director living links center universitys yerkes national primate research center
study de waal colleagues dr diana reiss joshua plotnik introduced three adult female asian elephants happy patty maxine large mirror placed exhibit bronx zoo new york city
according paper animals typically social response towards reflection see mirror try inspect mirror looking behind animals parrots dogs cats show behaviours
three elephants different reactions reflections elephant played sort peekaboo swaying heads trunks bodies mirror view even brought food front mirror watched eat
maxine took trunk stuck mouth though investigating inside oral cavity also used trunk pull ear slowly forward towards mirror
x marks spot
researchers next painted two x marks foreheads elephants one mark invisible control odour tactile cues fully visible
mark test scientific standard determining whether animal recognises mirror
soon happy saw visible mark touched trunk front mirror 47 times maxine patty however ignored marks foreheads
believe elephants love dustbathe throw food dirt backs storage relatively small mark head might bother says plotnik
chimpanzees humans groom picking things bodies elephants love covered dirt mud
hardly surprising
dr lori marino senior lecturer neuroscience behavioural biology emory worked earlier dolphinmirror study
surprised elephants recognise mirror
like dolphins great apes humans elephant brains large highly convoluted social lives extraordinarily complex marino says
adds many animals possess selfawareness multifaceted complex phenomenon seems manifest different levels
since elephant selfawareness empathy similar level humans plotnik hopes findings strengthen commitment towards conservation especially wild elephant population continues plummet due habitat loss poaching

pigs important domestic animal pacific
sacred pigs vanuatu shedding new light domestic pigs spread throughout world say us australian researchers
dr koji lum binghamton university new york state colleagues publish study pacific island pigs proceedings national academy sciences
pigs important domestic animal pacific cultures important source food basis societal wealth
also sacred animals cultures believe souls
yet origin pacific pig breeds long unresolved
lum team studied mitochondrial dna mtdna two kinds sacred pigs island nation vanuatu
one male narave type intersex pigs dont produce enough steroid complete masculinsation say researchers cannot reproduce amongst
breed therefore carried forward female carriers navare traits
second type sacred pig hairless kapia
lum team includes kirk huffman australian museum compared mtdna pigs vanuatu mtdna pigs burma vietnam china ryukyu islands
found narave pig dna matched dna breeds domesticated southeast asia 3000 years ago
data suggests navare pigs recently domesticated within southeast asia dispersed human colonisation remote oceania associated lapita cultural complex write researchers
interestingly researchers found native pacific pig studied kapia shared much dna introduced european breeds
two thirds dna kapia pig samples came berkshire large black breeds introduced europeans
researchers say breeds would chosen crossing native breeds dark coat natives ensuring offspring remained protected tropical sun
nice half story
previous study comparing pig skulls professor colin groves australian national university also concluded southeast asia likely origin pacific pigs
lum study nice little confirmation already suspected says groves
says using mtdna comes maternal line means researchers finding origin female pigs
theyre getting half story says
groves says tested dna chromosome kapia example may find main source recently introduced pig dna via use introduced boars rather sows
groves says domestic pigs widespread world today come europe actually ultimately either chinese origin half chinese half european
says european farmers bred pigs fatter chinese breeds get better domestic animal

patients frantically plugging symptoms google see disease might australian researchers say doctors
dr hangwi tang dr jennifer ng princess alexandra hospital brisbane report findings today online british medical journal
tang says study driven personal curiosity noticing patients doctors alike using google diagnose difficult cases
one example patient whose father used search engine correctly diagnose son rare circulatory condition pagetvon schrötter syndrome
tang ng selected 26 difficult cases presented new england journal medicine including cushings syndrome creutzfeldtjakob disease encephalitis cirrhosis
plugged symptoms case search engine come diagnosis
diagnoses compared correct published diagnoses researchers found google got right 58 time
say online search likely effective helping diagnose conditions unique symptoms used search terms
tang says part challenge using google able efficiently sift many pages links get online search
thinks doctors better placed patients better selecting relevant links
dont think google replace doctors words says tang
millions facts
doctors estimated carry two million facts heads help diagnose disease researchers say
search engines allow get quick access ever increasing medical knowledge base might impossible hold head
google particular gives access three billion articles say google scholar restricting searches peer reviewed articles
tang says number search engines clinicians use often prefer google easy use freely available
studies
professor johanna westbrook centre health informatics sydney says findings consistent
team looked specialised search engines could help clinicians diagnose treat patients using best available evidence
study found clinicians 21 likely give correct answers used online search engines
interestingly though clinicians got wrong answers using search engines although got right answers without
westbrook says underscores importance learning interpret complex evidence
another interesting finding clinical nurse consultants using search engines accurate doctors
westbrook says suggests search engines might help nurses diagnose treat patients rural areas fewer doctors
online search engine available 24 hours day says whereas cant get clinician 24 hours day cant get hospital library 24 hours day
westbrook says google might good helping find information diseases unique symptoms sophisticated search engines would required complex diseases
gene type governs brain size may neanderthal origin exists modern humans
neanderthals may given modern humans replaced priceless gift gene helped develop superior brains us researchers report
way could provided gift would interbreeding say scientists
study published online proceedings national academy sciences week provides indirect evidence modern homo sapiens neanderthals interbred point lived side side europe
finding evidence mixing surprising study demonstrates possibility interbreeding contributed advantageous variants human gene pool subsequently spread says professor bruce lahn howard hughes medical institute researcher university chicago led study
scientists debating whether neanderthals died 35000 years ago ever bred modern h sapiens neanderthals considered primitive robust bones smaller intellects modern humans
lahns team found brain gene appears entered human lineage 11 million years ago
modern form allele appeared 37000 years ago right neanderthals became extinct
gene microcephalin mcph1 regulates brain size development experienced positive selection lineage leading homo sapiens researchers write
positive selection means gene conferred sort advantage people likely descendants people
common variant
lahns team estimate 70 living humans type variant gene
means findings constitute definitive proof neanderthal source original copy allele however evidence shows one best candidates lahn says
researchers reached conclusions statistical analysis dna sequence microcephalin known play role regulating brain size humans
mutations human gene cause development much smaller brain condition called microcephaly
tracking smaller regular mutations researchers looked dnas genetic clock dated original genetic variant 37000 years ago
note allele common europe neanderthals lived rare africa
whats advantage
lahn says yet clear advantage allele gives human brain
alleles may even change brain size may make brain bit efficient indeed affects brain function says

researchers even get need explain fundamental mystery m15s dust says woodward
lots dust
according accepted theory cosmic dust needs seeded heavier elements like silicon oxygen carbon tend products bigger shortlived stars
m15s big old stars poor heavy elements theres still lots dust
form dust dont metals around condense says woodward astronomers call elements heavier hydrogen helium metals
fact dust could forming space without metals could mean astronomers may revise basic theories sort dust newer stars planets form
much dust ultimately galaxy decades astronomers figured dustiest places stars forming cosmic dust makes stars first place
also suspected aged stars like m15 lose mass space witnessed taking form dust
one reason dust old stars elusive says woodward stars clusters formed time milky way 125 billion years ago
thats awful lot time clusters bob like dolphin galactic plane

protein soup makes semen trigger serious allergic reactions women
women become allergic partners men according new research presented week us conference
culprit semen reports dr david resnick acting director division allergy new york presbyterian hospital
research due presented annual meeting american college allergy asthma immunology philadelphia
isnt sperm accompanying proteins cause allergic response phenomenon allergy experts recognising often says
reported deaths allergic response semen women may require hospitalisation experiencing difficulty breathing hives swelling
less severe cases may result itching burning swelling intercourse
women may reaction aware says resnick
women think theres another problem infection condom allergy resnick says
one survey 1073 women sought related information researcher approximately 13 determined semen allergy
sufferers resnick explains produce antibody recognises proteins partners semen
antibody triggers powerful immune response similar mild cases hay fever women allergic semen certain partner others react multiple men
allergens transmitted seminal fluid
include medications penicillin even foods beverages walnuts soft drinks women allergies tend prone semen allergies

two basic types treatment available first similar standard allergy treatments expose sufferer allergen diluted doses
second involves removing proteins known sometimes interfere desensitisation process semen plasma injecting small amount processed semen regular intervals
cases frequent sexual contact needed treatment
actually one case male spouse unable engage frequent intercourse wife developed allergy says resnick
jonathan bernstein professor medicine university cincinnati one worlds leading experts semen allergies says agrees resnick
believes processed semen though expensive treatment would effective
bernstein also believes allergy probably underreported
may rare people think says allergy may go unrecognised yet significant effect relationships
comets may caused giant tsunamis much recently much frequently anyone thinks
enormous comets may often bombarded oceans causing tsunamis dwarf ones seen today says small group scientists
critics yet convinced theres evidence back claims recent frequent megaimpacts
conventional wisdom earth suffers violent hits space twice every million years
scientists including australian geomorphologist associate professor ted bryant university wollongong studying say evidence massive objects slamming earths oceans recently 500 years ago
say kilometrewide objects likely comets
bryant says 10 impacts past 10000 years based research others including assistant professor dallas abbott lamontdoherty earth observatory columbia university
bryant says would caused megatsunamis 10 times bigger 2004 asian tsunami one largest earthquakegenerated tsunamis world ever seen
aceh dimple compared looking says bryant associate dean science university

bryant used satellite images google earth identify inland dunes shape arrowheads says signs megatsunamis
tsunamis would displaced marine deposits containing marine fossils says dumping inland chevron dunes
weve found chevrons everywhere everywhere around worlds coasts says
abbot used sea surface altimetry measures height sea surface get image seabed identify possible underwater craters could evidence impact caused tsunamis
bryant says abbot also looked melted material cores seabed around craters confirm impacts caused
chevrons craters linked direction chevrons pointing
example two chevrons identified 6 kilometres inland gulf carpentaria australia pointed north direction two craters found gulf carpentaria says bryant
dating sediments north craters suggests impact happened 1500 years ago says wellpreserved chevrons also date around time
indian ocean crater
bryant says chevrons 4800 years old around indian ocean associated 29 kilometre wide impact crater located thousands kilometres southeast madagascar
chevrons around indian ocean point back one crater site says
says supported evidence anthropologist team found 170 myths legends area dating back 4000 years referring event could impact
bryant says evidence megatsunami recently 500 years ago found eastern coast australia
abbott linked one impact crater south stewart island new zealand

paabos team says hopes complete genetic sequence within two years
say neanderthal sequences 9995 identical human dna sequences compares 98 similarity humans chimpanzees split common ancestor 6 7 million years ago
threeway comparisons among human chimpanzee neanderthal genomes shed light makes modern humans unique experts agree
rubin experts stress full sequences human genome available little understood code actually means

new research suggests whale communication even sophisticated previously thought
whales broad vocal repertoire call young woo potential mates even express emotions according researchers identified 622 social sounds humpback whales
work presented upcoming joint meetings acoustical society america acoustical society japan hawaii
social sounds brief unpatterned noises distinct lengthier complex whale songs
new research adds growing body evidence whales convey meaning vocalisations previously thought
wouldnt say whales possess language thats human term says dr rebecca dunlop researcher school veterinary sciences university queensland worked study
whales dont string sounds together like words form sentences like simple vocabulary says
scientists visually tracked 60 pods whales migrating along east coast australia
researchers used static hydrophone array sensitive equipment detects sound waves linking whale sounds various activities contexts
wops thwops yaps
identified 622 distinct sounds fell 35 basic types
include wops made females thwops made males yaps made pods split high pitched cries appeared express anger
addition vocalisations researchers found whales send messages body language breaching surface slapping water tails blowing underwater bubbles
famous long complex songs whales also sometimes speak short song units individually instead singing
males especially seem trying woo female
song loud broadcast signal two singers singing time bound confusing receiver dunlop says
hes trying attract female doesnt want signal confused another singer area using song units case might way forward
thinks one reason whales vocal sound travels better water light sight less useful whales hearing
human interference
dr christopher clark director bioacoustics research program cornell university conducted similar study right whales
says researchers gaining better understanding whale vocalisations humans creating much ocean noise shipping oil gas exploration recreational traffic often prevent whales communicating
many whales traditional feeding grounds migratory routes occur along shallow coastlines noisiest heavily impacted habitats says

firefighters face longterm health risks new research shows
firefighters appear higherthanaverage rates cancer largest study kind shows
analysis 32 previous studies shows firefighters greater risk prostate testicular cancers well immune system cancers nonhodgkins lymphoma multiple myeloma
eight additional cancers show possible links job according findings published journal occupational environmental medicine
firefighters exposed many potentially cancercausing chemicals released burning materials
though wear breathing apparatus protective equipment fighting fires researchers point typically remove gear theyre merely vicinity fire
scene fire toxic substances benzene lead uranium asbestos inhaled absorbed skin fire station idling trucks expose firefighters diesel exhaust
cancer risks seen latest study suggest firefighters need better onthejob protection according study authors
firefighters work inherently dangerous occupation daily basis says lead author dr grace lemasters university cincinnati college medicine
colleagues based findings analysis 32 international studies included 110000 firefighters
across studies firefighters double risk testicular cancer men occupations 50 higher risk multiple myeloma nonhodgkins lymphoma 28 higher risk prostate cancer
findings raise red flags lemasters colleagues write point need innovative comfortable protective equipment allowing firefighters job without compromising health
another immediate measure would firefighters shower soon return fire station researchers say
investigators note found firefighters often say skin ends covered soot battling blaze
male chimps fight older females seen prize catch
chimpanzee males prefer sex older females according us researchers showing one biggest behavioural differences humans closest biological relatives
male chimps chase fight oldest females
meanwhile youngest female chimps forced beg masculine attention say anthropologist assistant professor martin muller colleagues boston university
really dramatic old chimps avoiding youngest adult females actually strong preference older mothers muller says
writing journal current biology muller colleagues say studied chimpanzees living kanyawara community kibale national park uganda
easy observe mating behaviour
chimpanzee copulations frequently preceded series male courtship signals eg glancing erect penis branch shaking either male female approaches mate researchers write
also collected chimps urine test various hormones demonstrate fertility
researchers checking see chimpanzees behave like humans closest living relatives form longterm mating bonds value younger females
definitely case chimps oldest adult females sought
males fight muller says
dont anything get males interested males find follow around look youngest females males mate take work females part
showing
also unlike humans female chimpanzees actively advertise fertile bright red swellings around genital area
unlike human females chimpanzees apparently remain fertile entire lives although wild ugandan chimpanzees rarely lived beyond age 40
muller says older female chimpanzees dominant socially access better food
females access food fecund likely conceive cycle says males may know
older females may also better mothers researchers guess
males end mating females part muller notes says study challenges common conceptions
normally think peoples default assumption well animals must also find young females attractive muller says people assume young females fertile older females
female chimpanzees experience rapid decline fertility seen human females 20s
happens tissue thats removed biopsy stored liquid nitrogen

tissue used inhouse research passed institutions private companies
laws relating stored tissue confusing contradictory differences state federal jurisdictions says bronwen morrell present studys interim findings australian health medical research congress melbourne week
says study indicates people want laws setting basic parameters consent information type research whether tissue used profit
morrell asked participants range questions including whether sort research wouldnt want tissue used
two things came repeatedly cloning stem cells says
cloning came repeatedly interesting think thinking reproductive cloning isnt allowed australia anyway obviously thats something thats much mind
federal government currently debating recommendations lockhart review allow therapeutic cloning australia reproductive cloning remains banned
morrell says study also shows people trust public sector tissue private companies
long research done public hospital would feel comfortable says

cooling towers one option getting rid waste heat power plants
australian nuclear power plants would likely need built coast gigalitres seawater could used cool suggest experts
weve got water shortage country would best place coast says nuclear power engineer professor john price monash university melbourne
prices comments come wake draft report prime minister john howards nuclear taskforce proposes constructing 25 nuclear power plants meet australias future energy needs
price welcomes new report says gigantic amounts water required cool nuclear power station
im talking tonnes per second says price designed nuclear power stations uk
according taskforce headed nuclear physicist dr ziggy switkowski nuclear power plants less efficient coalfired plants thus require cooling
one estimate recent report queensland government suggests 1400 megawatt nuclear power station would use around 25 gigalitres water year
126 times water used equivalent coalfired power station says report dr ian rose roam consulting queenslandbased company expertise energy modelling
water cooling
switkowski report consider specific locations nuclear power plants australia says often located near existing power stations ensures ready access appropriate infrastructure water cooling
nuclear power stations cooled using water river lake ocean report says
rose report says lack reliable river water makes nuclear power station cooled river water option australian conditions
rose price also raise issue environmental effects warmer water discharged nuclear power stations rivers
wouldnt think would good idea siting nuclear power station river australia river volumes huge dont want heat river says price
price suggests power stations sea preferable sea easily dilute heat discharge
rose says may difficult find suitable seaside locations
number seaboard nuclear sites areas close major transmission grid eastern australia likely limited report says
us environmental protection agency says discharge nuclear power stations also contain heavy metals salts harm aquatic life
also says removal water upstream first place also damage river environments
cooling options
instead discharging warm water nuclear power stations evaporate water air cooling towers price says
rose says preferred option price says waste water
according switkowski rose reports also possible use dry cooling reduces water consumption using air coolant say would expensive
another option says price use waste heat nuclear power stations desalinate water

ngarrindjeri people put repatriated remains ancestors rest image used permission aboriginal community
aboriginal human remains stolen name science reburied traditional burial mounds using latest technology ensure existing burials disturbed
reburial project involving ngarrindjeri people south australia discussed australian archaeological association conference melbourne next week
members thriving medical research community took ngarrindjeri human remains 19th century late 1950s says flinders university archaeologist dr lynley wallis helping project
says literally thousands tens thousands bodies removed
people stealing bodies graves around adelaide says adding many traditional burial mounds sand dunes made particularly easy bodies taken
sometimes within days weeks burial says worse taken morgue adelaide
remains sent places british museum museum edinburgh uk well south australian museum museum victoria australia says willis
2003 museum edinburgh became first repatriate remains 300 ngarrinjeri people
remains always complete sets bones says
sometimes might organ jar sometimes skull sometimes leg bone
remains 2200 years old says many never examined
voices aboriginal community
wallis keen emphasise cannot speak behalf ngarrindjeri community representatives immediately contactable
interview last year flinders university researcher chair ngarrindjeri heritage committee uncle tom trevorrow explained need reburial ceremonies repatriated remains old people term respect used referring ancestors
forced repeat funeral ceremony people gone taken old peoples bodies without listening us getting permission said
dont know old people dont know theyve done
customary burial ceremony involves smoking bodies allow spirits travel rest
disturbed resting places ceremony needed carried uncle tom said
role archaeologists
using limited paperwork accompanying remains ngarrindjeri community identifying burial mounds taken
come river thats country come lake thats group said uncle tom
first reburial took place hacks point 23 september year
make sure didnt disturb people cultural objects already buried mounds community called wallis others help
last thing wanted disturb existing burials says wallis
team used various geophysical techniques work areas burial mound could dig safely
first time technology used indigenous reburials australia says wallis
researchers used magnetometer detect mineral maghaemite could formed fires used ceremonies
team also used electromagnetic induction detects changes moisture conductivity sediments occur ground disturbed
combining results two surveys team identified location burial mound disturbance
remains 23 people repatriated museum edinburghwere reburied first ceremony
thankfully science worked didnt hit existing burials says wallis
signs ancestors
wallis says day first reburial storm blew nearby kangaroo island ngarrindjeri people call island dead spirits go people buried
thought old people stirring knew something happen says wallis
day large flock pelicans flew burial ceremony says wallis present reburial
pelicans known ngori totem ngarrindjeri people flock seen spirits old people coming see burial says wallis
amazing huge flocks flying formation didnt believe indigenous connection country going process certainly would

future nuclear says new report australias rich uranium resources
new nuclear technology cut waste significantly may longer need dump underground according australian government report
report tabled parliament week also says australia lift restrictions uranium exploration mining export present nuclear power reliable proven way cutting greenhouse gas emissions
advanced nuclear reactors spent fuel reprocessing technologies developed significantly reduce quantity toxicity nuclear waste says report australias uranium greenhouse friendly fuel energy hungry world
technological advances could potentially obviate need geological repositories altogether
new generation reactors could also reduce isolation period needed waste hundred years
dr mark diesendorf institute environmental studies university new south wales dismissed comments propaganda nuclear industry
says 440 nuclear reactors operating around world today almost identical 25 years ago
speculation future reactors market says comments made report
reducing waste
nuclear waste consists spent uranium plutonium byproducts critics like diesendorf say needs managed hundreds thousands years
professor stephen lincoln expert nuclear energy uranium university adelaide says possible recycle waste turning mixed uraniumplutonium oxide mox
instead using uranium oxide fuel rods use mixed uranium plutonium burns plutonium also produces nuclear power says
professor leslie kemeny australian foundation member international nuclear energy academy consultant nuclear physicist says three reactors around world already using socalled mox
kemeny says well also get better developing ways using waste nuclear reactors energy source use industry hospitals
firmly believe everything taken reactor core put waste depository highly valuable says
improving safety
kemeny says new technology cut back waste make nuclear reactors safer
says pebblebed reactors developed package uranium graphite balls rather iron rods making waste easier handle
generation iv reactors go fuel element enriched particles uranium interspersed silicon carbon small ball hexagonal shaped fuel element says
circulate balls reactor drop set orangesized tennis ballsized take ones long time
pebblebed reactors cooled gas like helium carbon dioxide reduce risk overheating chernobylstyle meltdown says
deisendorf says according calculations pebblebed reactors would produce 13 times nuclear waste conventional ones
dont rods 13 times quantity nuclear waste youre embedding fuel pebbles pebbles occupy lot volume becomes highly radioactive says
lincoln says pebble bed rectors fine principle none currently used generate power fuel expensive produce
bring new technology got proved tested final analysis commercially competitive terms producing electricity comparison currently used reactors says
lincoln says degree technological sophistication ensure 100 safety nuclear reactors adds difficult imagine reactor advanced produces waste
true modern reactors better respect produce less waste theyre always going produce says
still quite significant issue point time one single permanent storage highlevel nuclear waste
reef sharks australias great barrier reef fished brink extinction new report suggests
southeast asias voracious appetite shark fin soup may contributing dramatic drop number reef sharks australias great barrier reef marine scientist says
dr sean connolly colleagues james cook university found 10fold decrease shark numbers areas fishing allowed conducting first shark census world heritage listed area
study published latest issue journal current biology looked two species shark grey reef shark carcharhinus amblyrhynchos whitetip reef shark triaenodon obesus
sharks observed across four fishing management zones ranging strict noentry open fishing
found fishing strictly banned shark numbers 10 times higher zones fishing connolly says
see populations severely depleted already also projections say declines ongoing quite rapid
study sent divers count shark numbers well using mathematical modelling taking account births deaths population growth patterns
found whitetip reef sharks declining average rate 7 year 17 rate decline grey reef sharks
study predicts trend continues populations drop 5 01 would without fishing
shark fin soup
conolly says results show fishing threatening reef sharks ecological extinction numbers small longer play role marine ecosystem
overfishing could driven international market shark fins says
people fishing certain areas reef able catch sharks sell fins separately although must bring back carcass
probably selling shark fin international market pressure likely increase price fins goes growing demand increasingly depleted shark populations connolly says
sharks also often viewed pest anglers looking game coral trout says could caught accident
one main causes decline sharks whats called bycatch species means catch mistake youre trying get something else says
total landings shark species great barrier reef increased four fold past 10 years connolly says
impact reef
sharks sit top reef food chain connolly says hard predict exactly loss would affect coral reef ecosystem
modelling suggests removing sharks erode resilience coral reefs take sharks smaller predators system could increase number could potentially decrease number grazing seaweed eating fish says
study concludes immediate substantial reductions shark fishing needed reef populations recover

neanderthal foot bones block cemented sand clay el sidrón cave spain
neanderthals different ethnic groups often starved probably practised cannibalism
thats news recent study skeletal remains eight neanderthals lived 43000 years ago northwest spain
findings published online proceedings national academy sciences raise questions neanderthal lifestyle
instance would resorted cannibalism harsh conditions caused wear tear evident surviving bones
two possible reasons neanderthals would dined dead according lead author dr antonio rosas scientist palaeobiology department national museum natural sciences madrid
one needed eat whatever hand including human flesh ecological conditions survivorship extreme cold weather meat hunting really hard rosas says
possibility says done context something may think symbolic
rosas suggests virtual absence animal remains site cave called el sidroacuten may point either ritual killings unsuccessful hunting neanderthals thought subsisted primarily meat
toothy clues
neanderthals studied ranged age infancy young adulthood teeth revealed tooth growth often stopped abruptly due illness malnutrition
adolescence general appears particularly hard time possibly due separation parents resulting need selfsufficiency
cut marks associated butchery found remains particularly younger individuals
skeletal remains also reveal neanderthals possess different bone structure individuals found elsewhere europe
appears neanderthals fell least two basic ethnic groups coincided northsouth geographical distribution
southern neanderthals iberian peninsula balkans middle east italy broader shorter faces northern neanderthals populations living north pyrenees alps portions asia central eastern europe researchers say
scientists debating whether interbreeding modern humans occurred neanderthal groups appear gone extinct
look variety data neanderthals subject episodes extreme scarcity cultural social systems sometimes couldnt cope says professor steven kuhn anthropologist university arizona
could also link boomandbust subsistence occasional cannibalism

know someone well doesnt mean choose right present new research shows
really want mp3 player christmas beloved buys radio dont disappointed
new international research suggests knowing someone well actually makes predicting tastes difficult
study published december issue journal consumer research goes way explaining people often miss mark end buying weird inappropriate plain bad gifts ones love
researchers netherlands belgium invited 35 couples relationship least six months predict partners taste furniture
70 participants first asked choose favourite bedroom suites 30 offer
half asked predict partners favourites half asked predict favourites stranger person x reality partner
researchers conclude knowing lot partner actually get way choosing perfect gift
people become overconfident know partner like tendency assume tastes similar mean often miss cue theyre getting wrong
results suggest familiarity causes people put overly heavy weight prestored information write authors
prestored information people possess partner extensive elaborate knowledge makes predictors overly confident even attend productspecific attitude feedback
australian professor psychology university new south wales joseph forgas says hardly surprising people get wrong buying presents others often get wrong buying things
possible reason affluence
people already pretty much everything real utility value discretionary purchases buy items dont really need ie goods symbolic identity value minimal utility value says
purchases mainly make statements people good figuring statement make make
example people may think buying red ferrari signals power wealth others may signal sexual inadequacy impotence

ten studies published since 1999 identified human papillomavirus breast tumours studies needed show closely two linked
breast cancer could sexually transmitted says researcher found virus causes cervical cancer breast cancer tumours australian women
emeritus professor james lawson university new south wales colleagues found form human papillomavirus hpv associated cervical cancer almost half breast tumour samples tested
first study kind australia although international studies also found cervical cancerrelated hpv breast cancer cells
says evidence far conclusive possible totally worthy investigation suspect hpv could also cause breast cancer
lawson says possible hpv spread sexual activity showers baths virus could transferred genital area breasts via nipple ducts
know virus explodes cell spread touch fairly obvious could spread sexual activity breast could also argue would spread washing bathing says
lawson says research needed establish whether hpv actually causing breast cancer women breast cancer prone infection virus
younger women
lawson colleagues last year published results dna analysis found 24 50 breast cancer samples also tested positive hpv 18 form virus implicated breast cancer
subsequent review published journal future microbiology june year found various forms highrisk hpv identified 10 separate breast cancer studies since 1999
letter published online british journal cancer last month lawson reports review 2005 study found women hpv positive breast cancers average eight years younger whose tumours test positive virus
says lends weight sexual transmission theory hpv common younger women likely older women multiple sexual partners something describes postpill phenomenon
lawson says isnt first time virus associated breast cancer
mouse mammary tumour virus causes breast cancer mice known since 1930s 2004 study lawson reported finding genetically similar version virus australian women
lawson says true hpv cause breast cancer well cervical cancer introduction cervical cancer vaccine developed australian year professor ian frazer also cut rates breast cancer
says currently pushing study
real proof vaccine youll wait long time results says
makes sense follow group girls get breast cancer see hpv positive breast cancers
theoretically answer
doubts
chief executive officer cancer council australia professor ian olver says possible virus could cause breast cancer existing studies small inconclusive
weve got small studies found association hpv breast cancer havent shown anything could say causal says
think need much bigger studies mechanism hpv implicated development
recent article published online ahead appearing journal breast failed find evidence hpv study 81 swiss women

new research shows outermost layer atmosphere lose 3 density coming decade sign farreaching impacts greenhouse gas emissions density declines orbiting satellites space junk experience less drag
human increases carbon dioxide emissions thinning earths outer atmosphere making easier keep space station aloft prolonging life dangerous space junk scientists say
bit twoedge sword says stanley solomon us scientist national center atmospheric research boulder colorado
future little bit easier keep space station instance orbit need little bit less fuel says
hand give space junk much longer lifetime told meeting american geophysical union san francisco
solomon coauthor study presented week found burning fossil fuels increase carbon dioxide emissions make earths outer atmosphere 100 kilometres 3 less dense 2017
study also published journal geophysical research letters found decrease density 5 1970 2000
although scientists say carbon dioxide contributes global warming closer earths surface thinner outer atmosphere spacecraft orbit cooling effect takes place solar activity also affects outer atmosphere
outermost region becomes less dense produces less drag satellites spacecraft tens thousands pieces discarded space debris previous missions orbiting 400 kilometres earths surface

researcher suggested origin aboriginal language traced back time australia new guinea one
aboriginal languages may much older people think argues linguistic anthropologist says originated far back end last ice age around 13000 years ago
challenges existing thinking suggests aboriginal languages developed protolanguage spread australia 5000 6000 years ago
key new hypothesis prehistoric australias single land mass 13000 28000 years ago new guinea tasmania still attached says dr mark clendon journal current anthropology
clendon says continent known sahul relatively densely populated land bridge connecting northern australia new guinea separated arafura sea
populated area along australias eastern seaboard
two population groups separated vast cold windswept arid stretch land covered continent says clendon batchelor institute indigenous tertiary education published research
eastern group spoke tongue became known today pama nyungan includes languages like pitjantjatjara yolngu warlpiri
arafurans spoke another family languages used northern australia today
im suggesting pama nyungan nonpama nyungan languages go back 13000 years land bridge new guinea australia says
reason two aboriginal language groups different distinct grammar vocabulary mystery
climate change
around 11000 years ago arafura plain flooded rising seas ice age ended
caused northern people migrate either new guinea northern parts australia
meanwhile increased rainfall warmer temperatures made inland parts continent habitable sparked westward migration eastern dwellers
introduced language group central areas australia
groups maintained distinct languages clendon says
hypothesis provides alternative picture traditional view 6000 years ago single protolanguage spread gulf carpentaria around australia eventually giving rise existing aboriginal languages
know changes climate sea levels end pleistocene era clendon says
im suggesting way languages configured australia today result changes happened end ice age
provocative unconvincing
writing reply clendons article professor nicholas evans expert aboriginal languages university melbourne describes clendons hypothesis fresh provocative

pollution factored csiro model includes industrial domestic emissions particles black carbon burning diesel sulfide particles coal
rotstayn says aerosol pollution cooling effect forms blanket keeps suns radiation reaching surface earth
particles also cause thicker persistent clouds reflect heat back space
cooling effect aerosols combination direct effect stopping sunlight getting indirect effect whereby aerosols make clouds effective says
aerosol haze cooling asia oceans around thats affecting monsoonal winds bring summertime rainfall northern parts australia
says trend could reversed serious implications australia asian emissions reduced
sooner later emissions cleaned trend increasing rainfall northwest centre could reversed says
potentially serious northwest centre parts australia rainfall increasing
greenhouse problem
study shows shouldnt underestimate impact aerosols australias climate rotstayn says
dont really much aerosol pollution australia time theres assumption aerosols important australian climate
simulations without aerosols got completely different rainfall response australia
thats suggesting aerosols something take seriously going able predict climate change simply treat solely greenhouse gas problem clearly

tapping boswellia tree frankincense eritrea
jesus born today three wise men might substitute frankincense another gift according new research suggesting production fragrant substance trouble
frankincense aromatic hardened wood resin obtained tapping boswellia trees ingredient perfumes incense thousands years
bible says christmas magi brought gifts jesus gold frankincense myrrh
ecologists netherlands eritrea warn current rates tapping frankincense boswellia trees endangering sustained production aromatic resin
writing december issue journal applied ecology professor frans bongers wageningen university says overtapping trees results producing fewer less viable seeds
production horn africa declining boswellia woodlands failing regenerate
ecologists hypothesise poor regeneration due intensive tapping means trees diverting much carbohydrate resin expense reproductive organs flowers fruit seeds
tested theory looking many seeds produced intensively tapped trees southwestern eritrea compared untapped trees germination rates
study sites trees subject experimental tapping produced fewer flowers fruit seeds trees exempt tapping bongers says
furthermore tapped trees produced smaller fruits seeds lower weight reduced vitality nontapped trees
ecologists suggest changing way trees tapped reducing number tapping points per tree enabling rest periods would help ensure production sustainable
order control decline fruit seed production less intensive tapping procedures developed write
results show six tapping points per tree already negative impact suggest reducing number tapping points
new tapping regimes also include rest periods resin harvesting allow trees recover

experiment could reproduced humans cells might provide alternative way produce tailored tissues transplanting studying disease daley says
aggressively trying produce human parthenogenetic embryonic stem cells says

researchers say produced dozens genetically matched mice embryonic stem cell lines means novel procedure called parthenogenesis
word comes latin greek roots meaning virgin beginning process occurs egg cell starts dividing produce embryo without using sperm fertilise
researchers generated stem cells unfertilised mouse eggs screened ensure would rejected rodents immune system injected back mouse
customised cells successfully transplanted yielded many types specialised tissue possibly absence male dna
study establishes principle using unfertilised eggs source customised embryonic stem cells genetically screened ensure carry genes allow recipients immune system recognise making fit transplantation therapies
scientists experimented parthenogenesis mice first time procedure yielded embryonic stem cells socalled master cells potential develop type cell body
studys authors particularly encouraged unfertilised mice eggs produced embryonic stem cells 70 time

humans may able understand dogs bark mammals speak universal language
dog barks common bird tweets human baby cries
appear communicate basic emotions fear aggression submission somewhat acoustic way according new study journal applied animal behaviour science
find suggests primitive communication system may unite virtually mammals
theory could help explain previous research found many mammals including humans understand vocalisations different species
example study journal language communication shows young children identify simple emotions conveyed macaque calls
recent research professor peacuteter pongraacutecz colleagues studied well people could describe emotional content several artificially assembled bark sequences
barks based sounds made mudi hungarian herding dog covered five emotional states aggressiveness fear despair playfulness happiness
pongraacutecz professor ethology eoumltvoumls loraacutend university budapest hungary team compared listeners answers barks acoustic features
scientists discovered changes three basic sound qualities tone pitch time barks determined listeners perceived barks
general highpitched barks longer intervals bark rated less aggressive lowerpitched barks heard frequent succession
like humans
human babies make similar changes sound quality cry except frequency range appears important pitch express needs
link pitch frequency perceived emotion appears carry across many different species according pongraacutecz cited earlier theory proposed avian expert professor eugene morton
basic argument according general physical laws larger bodies emit sounds characterised lower frequencies also noisieratonal thus receivers predict size sender pongraacutecz team write
relationship could formed basis evolutionary ritualisation process whereby lowpitched vocalisations tended signal aggression larger animals likely win contests highpitched vocalisations became predictors submission friendly intent
since people dog study also linked barks signifying despair happiness playfulness researchers suspect dogs humans share unique ability communicate one another goes beyond proposed universal mammal language
scientists believe years domestication improved way dogs versus wolf ancestors communicate us
point communication isnt limited vocalisations also includes visual signals changes looks

us scientists discovered levels two types good bacteria gut help break foods different obese lean people mice
finding reported today journal nature could lead better understanding people may prone obesity help find new ways preventing treating
gut microbial structure considered understanding elements might regulate energy balance may predispose us obesity says professor jeffrey gordon washington university school medicine st louis
something startling amount fat structure gut microbial community adds
trillions bacteria gastrointestinal tract two groups called bacteroidetes firmicutes dominant proportion varies lean obese mice humans
scientists found proportion bacteroidetes bacteria lower obese mice people lean people
gordon team studied 12 obese people followed lowcalorie diets year found levels bacteroidetes rose weight decreased
increased weight lost proportion amount weight loss says gordon
results suggest may microbial component obesity scientists yet know people start lower levels bacteroidetes firmicutes may make prone obesity
things exploring signals amount fat different groups bacteria exist gut says gordon
university cincinnati researchers writing accompanying commentary journal say
potentially revolutionary idea could change views causes obesity depend bacteria inhabit gut great deal remains poorly understood
komodo dragon virgin birth london zoo recently another batch expected chester zoo christmas
flora pregnant komodo dragon living uk zoo expecting eight babies scientists say could christmas virgin birth
flora never mated even mixed male dragon fertilised eggs process culminating parthenogenesis virgin birth
nobody wildest dreams expected female dragon produces clutch eggs eggs turn fertile nature finding way says kevin buley chester zoo
says incubating eggs could hatch around christmas
parthenogenesis occurred lizard species buley team says first time shown komodo dragons worlds largest lizards
scientists university liverpool discovered flora male help genetic tests three eggs collapsed put incubator
tests embryos flora sister dragons confirmed komodo dragons reproduce selffertilisation
genetic tests confirmed absolutely flora mother father embryos completely blew us away parthenogenesis never seen large species buley says
komodo dragon london zoo gave birth earlier year separated males two years
scientists thought able store sperm earlier encounter male
hearing floras eggs researchers conducted tests showed eggs also produced without male help
two institutions within short months previously unheard event really quite unprecedented says buley

researchers found dna associated nanoparticles kidney stones could strange particles nanobacteria
researchers whove found strange nanoparticles handful kidney stones say selfreplicating specks may play role disease
us researchers sure whether tiny particles 50 100 nanometres across living nanobacteria strange nonliving selfassembling ball chemicals
evidence would support either possibility says kidney specialist dr john lieske mayo clinic college medicine
colleagues report findings december issue journal investigative medicine

scientists arent sure causes deposits one theory lieske colleagues investigating tiny calciumcovered particles partly blame
previous research found particles human serum urine renal cysts patients kidney disease well kidney stones
lieske says researchers dub particles nanobacteria propose new diseasecausing agent
lieske says yet enough evidence particles alive
nanoparticle investigation
lieskes team isolated nanoparticles proteinlipid core surrounded calcium phosphate shell kidney stones
researchers grew nanoparticles culture period four eight weeks
